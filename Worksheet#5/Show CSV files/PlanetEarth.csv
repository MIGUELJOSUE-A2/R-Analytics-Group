"arjanhylkema","Nov 7, 2016","10",">10","As Planet Earth I was released about ten years ago, a visual improvement could have been expected due to the use of advanced technology, but man, did they up their game. The camera-work and the use of music were both truly superb, as well as the editing in which different sub- segments were all synced so well with the narrating of it by David Attenborough. It was nothing like a nature documentary, it was way beyond that. The short and different segments, were movies on itself. It contained all the different genres, from experiencing the thrill in a Hollywood-like impossible action-escape scenario to having a comical and truly euphoric moment of realization about the true extent of what nature has to offer. And this was all brought so incredibly well.If we had any more of such heavenly quality programs on TV, I would simply just glue my eyes to my TV and live out the rest of my life as a vegetable."
"Wentloog","Nov 5, 2016","10","At once awe-inspiring and terrifying!","I have just finished watching the first episode on BBC 1 and I am amazed to find that Planet Earth II appears to have bettered the original! The photography is perfect and Attenborough's narration, both content and delivery, is unparalleled. This initial outing is titled ""Islands"" and whilst I don't want to dwell on the individual segments, the Racer Snakes vs baby Iguanas is probably the most terrifying piece of natural history film I have ever witnessed, not for the fainthearted or squeamish!The ""making of segment at the end of the documentary proper was particularly enjoyable and informative.This is what the BBC does best and long may it last."
"john-m-madsen","Nov 5, 2016","10","Yet another masterpiece from BBC Nature & David Attenborough","What to say about Planet Earth II which has not already been said about so many other fantastic productions from BBC Nature?I've no idea.However: the production values are as always the very best in the business, the photography is likewise unmatched and it's all tied together with masterful insight and authority by David Attenborough, the man who through more than four decades has taught the planet more about the natural world than any ten others put together.Simply superb.The actual content? That you need to see for yourself."
"thespookybuz","Nov 9, 2016","10","Mesmerizing","The original Planet Earth back in 2006 was an astounding and refreshing series that tore down the limits of documentary making. It was universally lauded as exceptional, and if you haven't seen it then you're missing a genuine treat.Planet Earth II is everything its predecessor was. And more.Ultra sharp photography, iris-piercing colour and focus, and on a decent home set up, a superbly immersive experience. It is almost hypnotic the way the gorgeous landscapes and action scenes are interwoven with a sublime soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.The BBC receives criticism sometimes for the way it spends 'tax payers' money', but surely not for this. Whether you're aged 8 or 80, this is the highest quality television that will bewilder and astound.Truly wondrous, and David Attenborough is a legend."
"pjdickinson","Nov 5, 2016","10","Astounding","The professionalism of everyone involved in this glorious production is evident in every frame of what is seen and every second of what is heard. Most Hollywood blockbusters would struggle to compete with the cinematography on show here. Shot after shot seem almost impossible yet impossibly beautiful. Few things fill a viewer with simple awe but the first episode about islands does it and then some. The fact that it is all so enjoyable just adds to the experience. David Attenborough's narration is, as usual, superb.Whatever the cost it was worth it. The BBC has another hit."
"dbijis33","Nov 8, 2016","10","Dangerously beautiful","Hello this is my first written review. Note that I haven't watched the first season (2006) so I can't compare both.This series will get you the feels when you read a good book, watched a good movie, or played a good game, because this is more than good.THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE and of course with the danger of nature itself included.I don't know how they got those shots and the audio, even the music just like the rush when you first meet your crush, and the story with narration slaps you with the cold harsh of reality and the mesmerizing it gave. You are watching a book of life with enough drama and some bitter truth in every paradise, because life is never perfect.I'm very thankful for whomever people that makes this show to be realized, from the smallest task to the most dangerous.Thank you very much for this ineffable experience."
"dhanrajjughead","Nov 17, 2016","10","Greatest documentary ever created.","By far the greatest and best nature documentaries ever made. Everyone needs to watch this. I have no idea how many hours it must have taken to film this, and it seems like the people who made this are totally out of their minds. The snow leopard scenes in episode 2 are so brilliant it's amazing. It's one of the rarest animals ever shot on film and they've managed to shoot so much of it. It's crazy. They deserve every little credit they get. I'm thoroughly impressed by the work put into this and i'm sure it surpasses the work put into any Hollywood action film ever created. I think I learned a lot more from these people, more than how much I learned from the content itself."
"NeilBarnett","Nov 13, 2016","10","Best thing on TV since last Planet Earth","This is without doubt the best thing I have seen on television for years. The photography, narration and general story telling of the lives of the animals is simply breath-taking.Episode 1 was animals that live on islands. As others have mentioned I have never seen such a more terrifying piece of natural-history photography in my life. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it or caught it on YouTube but I never thought I would be shouting at the TV for Iguana's to run. Episode 2 was mountain living wildlife from Grizzly Bears coming out of hibernation to Snow Leopards. This programme is one of the few examples which envelopes you in its documentary telling. You are seeing things for the first time and you are left with wanting more. Roll on episode 3, jungles."
"salmanu-27386","Nov 6, 2016","10","Excellent","The opening image of Planet Earth II contained the promise of everything to come. It was spectacular, it was beautiful, it was magical. A hot air balloon floated like a snowflake, two miles abovean Alpine.The theme of the episode was ""Islands"", and we got off to a winningly cute start with a visit to idyllic Escudo, off Panama. Its star attraction is a three-toed pygmy sloth spurred into slow motion action by the cry of a potential mate. But no doubt what most people will remember, and talk about today, were the baby iguanas running the gauntlet of swarms of racer snakes on the Galapagos island of Fernandina.how beautiful our world and its living thing .....and how beautiful and big the creator of this whole universe ....I think people have to watch this types of films which is real one ."
"panagiotiskatsanos","Dec 31, 2016","10","One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen","One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen. Every episode is a new wonderful experience,getting to know the world that surrounds us. David Attenborough is the best narrator out there and this is his latest masterpiece. The crew has worked hard and managed to capture a large aspect of wild life whether it lives on a remote island in the arctic ocean or deep in one of the large human cities in India or United States of America. It shows that they put a lot of effort and time filming this under harsh conditions,but the close up captures of wild animals in their natural environment was worth the effort. Watched it already twice and will watch it again! This is something to watch again and again with your children, until the next Planet Earth arrives. Well done!"
"ianrobo","Nov 19, 2016","10","In times of climate deniers, hope","Plant Earth 2 was everything you would expect and more. Every scene, every vista shows that humans are the real parasites on this planet and the animals should rule us, not the other way round.However it gives me hope, it says to me people will watch this, hear about it and see the folly of our actions at some time.Hope is far better than despair.Oh David Attenborough, you are the king of us all"
"adamonIMDb","Dec 28, 2016","7","Breathtaking","I never thought the original 'Planet Earth' could be topped, but 10 years on and Attenborough has given us something that is every bit as good, if not even better, than the first series.'Planet Earth II' is everything I had hoped it would be and more. Visually breathtaking, mesmerising and at times unbelievable, with expert narration by the legendary David Attenborough. Documentaries as awe-inspiring as this don't come about very often.I always enjoy the 'making of' at the end of each episode, giving us an insight into the lengths that the crew go to capture the footage. They deserve a lot more credit than they get. 'Planet Earth' is, without question, the greatest documentary ever made and a must see."
"tinyfordst","May 19, 2019","10","More irritated with IMDb for the bias than with the show","Was Planet Earth 2 good? Absolutely, it was a visual masterpiece with locations that not even the creators of Avatar could've dreamt up, animals we didn't know existed (literally) and AMAZING music.The problem lies in the fact that the ""facts"" given were all a bit loosely based on the truth. A lot of what was said is suspicion, and even some of it has been proven wrong in the years that followed. Some of what was said has been proven false even before the show was recorded, but because the most beloved nature voice (David Attenborough) said it, nobody questioned anything.Finally what really bugs me is why IMDb decided to put it in first place with only 70 000 votes and not even with as few as that can it sustain a REAL average of 9.0. It makes no sense why it is placed ahead of shows with millions of votes that average a REAL 9.3. I believe it's time that IMDb admit, this show is not #1, because the ratings don't say it is, put Breaking Bad in the position it belongs, and which it deserves."
"BobFillmore","Sep 29, 2017","10","Should be required viewing in schools","This is probably the most intimate documentary I have seen of our fellow species on earth. Awesome. After having a bad day... watch this. Your problems will seem insignificant compared to life in general. We may be the top of the food chain. but this will illustrate the type of struggles we had to endure to get here. Humbling. Young people need to know their place in nature."
"farshidkarimi","Nov 22, 2016","10","What a Beautiful Planet- Bewitching !","This is my first comment and I hope I am not bungling it.I have been watching nature documentaries for many years. Everyone of them has been a depiction of beauty of nature and the planet we are living in.With all the bloodshed and cruelty that is unfolding all around, committed by US human beings, it is a relief to the heart, so soothing to the mind and calming to the eye to see such an enthralling master piece. The mesmerizing scenes of birds, soaring in the blue sky, their sleek feathers glimmering in the sun, the captivating green of leaves trembling in wake of monkeys jumping over them, the enchanting scene of Nubian Ibex baby deftly climbing down the cliff, dodging the red fox, the eye relieving sight of flamingos parading in a single line and all the grandeur of mountains superimposed by the stars in the time lapse, specks of ice swaying down in the winter scene and all enrapturing beauties of nature playing out right in front of our eyes, it is all a reminder of how majestic this world is.The trance is culminated by the legendary voice of the gem, Sir. David Attenborough. He is a major part of all this beauty. All this fragile beauty and all the majesty of these creatures invokes a feeling in the viewers mind and heart that this world, nature, animals and human beings living in it are mystically intertwined, connected and linked. I also bow in respect to the crew involved in the creation of this priceless jewel, especially the cameramen, honing it to perfection. I hope more people watch such stunning documentaries so that they will admire life on Planet Earth."
"TheLittleSongbird","Oct 12, 2017","10","Like the first 'Planet Earth', does for nature and our planet as 'Walking with Dinosaurs' did with the dinosaurs","Absolutely adore the first 'Planet Earth' from 2007, one of the best documentaries ever made and actually is more than that. David Attenborough (brother of director/actor Richard) is wisely considered a national treasure for very good reason, no matter how much he himself dislikes the term.So hearing that there was a second series nearly a decade later, there was absolutely no doubt as to whether to watch it. 'Planet Earth II' is as good as others have said and there is not much to add, it is along with its predecessor one of the best documentaries personally seen and most of the time it actually feels much more than that. Throughout it's an awe-inspiring, utterly transfixing experience where one forgets they're watching a documentary and instead feeling like they're watching art. This may sound like extreme hyperbole, but to me and many others 'Planet Earth II' is completely deserving of its praise and even deserving of more. To me as well, it is easily one of the best the BBC has done in years.'Planet Earth II' for starters looks amazing. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The scenery and habitats are some of the most breath-taking personally seen anywhere, whether in visual media and real life, the mountains in ""Mountains"" in particular are spectacular and ""Jungles"" captures the colour, excitement and formidable danger of the jungle beautifully. The rich colours just leap out. For a composer that composes normally bombastic, rousing and pulse-racing music that is epic even in the quieter moments, Hans Zimmer's music here is a remarkably good fit, it's unmistakably Zimmer in style but throughout it not only complements the visuals but enhances them.What of the narrative aspects? Can't fault 'Planet Earth II' in this aspect either. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surprise. In short, it's just fascinating, informative and thoughtful. This balance was even achieved in the ""Cities"" episode, that may have been the one that transfixed me the least due to being more invested in the animals and their habitats of the previous episodes.But the episode still managed to intrigue and illuminate, and credit has to go to 'Planet Earth II' for adhering to what made 'Planet Earth' work the first time and then bringing a freshness with a few nice ideas to avoid it being too stale. Attenborough delivers it beautifully, there's a soft-spoken enthusiasm and precision about his delivery and he never preaches.The animals themselves are a wonderful mix of the adorable (the penguins in ""Islands"") and the dangerous (the lions in ""Grasslands"" and ""Deserts""), and one actually finds they're rooting for them in exactly the same way they would a human character. 'Planet Earth II' contains a good deal of suspense (especially in ""Deserts"") and emotional impact (""Islands""). Even the fights/conflicts against the animals are completely riveting, some epic moments in ""Jungles"".It doesn't feel like six episodes either, and none of the episodes feel episodic or repetitive. 'Planet Earth II' instead feels like a collection of six individual stories with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it better than several.Overall, utterly mesmerising. For documentary lovers or fans of 'Planet Earth', 'Planet Earth II' is not to be missed at all costs and has more than enough to entice one to watch it again and again, finding something new each time and never getting tired of it. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"myersei-165-4350","Dec 4, 2016","10","This masterpiece deserves higher scores","It's a shame I can only give this breathtaking masterpiece 10 out of 10, it really deserves more. It is the single most astounding cinematic experience I have ever witnessed. The cinematography, narration, and score are hands down the best I have ever seen. Never has my entire family been so excited to watch the next episode of a program or movie.Planet Earth II lays out in 5 episodes life on earth in 6 separate Earth habitats: Islands, Mountains, Jungles, Deserts, Grasslands, and Cities. Each one dives into live and it's will to survive in a level you've never seen before. Truly remarkable cinematography and color will literally make you gasp for air and your eyes open wide. It truly is the greatest nature documentary ever made and possibly the greatest documentary of all time."
"larask-21775","Oct 20, 2018","10","Love it!","Stunning photography, excellent music, and the unique narration Attenborough brings make this an mini-series."
"fierceeagle-40009","Apr 23, 2020","10","Absolutely amazing.","Let me say the score, the music, the scenery, the animals and all the detail is like nothing you have seen before. When I'm dying in my bed i hope 60 years from now on my death bed this is what i want to be watching. It will give me peace on my way out of this magical and beautiful world. Just watch and see. Unfortunately for me i won't be able to go to certain parts of the world but seeing this makes me feel like I'm there."
"adam-whitmore","Jan 5, 2017","10","Peerless evocation of nature across the globe","This is not just one of the best wildlife documentaries ever made - superbly filmed using the latest techniques and equipment – it is one of the great achievements in any area of culture from this or any other year. Little else shows such skill and dedication from its makers, or is as moving in its sense of beauty and feeling of something larger than ourselves. It is an emotive evocation rather than cerebral narrative, and to this end there is extensive and prominent use of music, and added sound effects. Some find these intrusive, but for me they were very effective. There were a few occasions on which I felt that emphasis on getting in close went too far - for example the fighting Komodo dragons broke from the top of the frame unnecessarily, and the framing of eagles fighting over a carcass felt a little tight. However pushing the boundaries in any field can sometimes mean going too far, and this is surely trivial set against the scale of the achievement. Sequence after sequence is profoundly impressive, and the cumulative effect uniquely wonderful. This is of course worth seeing with the best quality source and the largest, best quality screen you can find. The Blu-ray transfer is excellent.In reviewing last year's outstanding ""The Hunt"" I wrote that I found it hard to imagine how even the BBC wildlife unit could surpass that. Now I see. Can even the BBC wildlife surpass this? Maybe Planet Earth 3?"
