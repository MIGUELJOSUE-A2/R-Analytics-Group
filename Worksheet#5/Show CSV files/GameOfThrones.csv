"danielkpkp","May 11, 2020","9","It could have been the best TV series ever made...","Till season 7 very likely the best TV show ever made in terms of suspense, character development, plot, effects, acting.... 10/10 with no doubt! But S6E10 is probably the point where you should stop and imagine your own ending. It is guaranteed better and has more character development. Otherwise you may end up rating it down by more than just one and are overcome by disappointment..."
"samxxx-671-826221","May 24, 2019","8","A perfect example of: Falling in Love with the Wrong Guy","It was a master piece. It was written to the perfection. It was mesmerizing. It was gripping. It was so shocking that if someone is binge watching this show he/she will need a time-off in between to get their head around things and accept some messed up, yet mind blowing development.But yet, I cant hate it enough after final season. Its like you came to know that you were in love with the wrong one all along. It was like looking at a completely different person. It was like seeing your own dreams and expectations get destroyed. It was not a let down, it was a BETRAYAL!"
"slowcando","May 20, 2019","8","Seasons 1-6: outstanding. 7: daft but good. 8: disappointing","Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad"
"SaifOVGU","Apr 8, 2020","10","Can you just make the remake the season finale?","I'm feeling so heartbroken to see everyone criticising my favourite show of all time. And yes of course that's because of the bad making of the season finale, I can totally understand that. After all these years hardwork, creating and developing each and every character from bottom to top, memories, emotions throughout the process all went to vain for one bad making. It's so painful to accept it for the audience who invested lots of time watching the show from the starting and then finishing it like this! It's a long long journey. I don't even remember the day I started watching it and since then I waited the next year to come for the new season. I can't say anything more. Only one last request, could you please delete the whole season 8 and make a new version of it? Please?"
"jacobnoble-02524","May 9, 2019","9","Game of Thrones","As we prepare for the House of the Dragon, we look back on the brilliance that once was Game of Thrones. Seasons 1-6 are truly outstanding television, right up there with The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Wire, best of the best. Season 7 was a drop in quality but still somewhat enjoyable, and then came Season 8 which was a blunder of epic proportions. A Rushed, botched, lazy ending and a slap in the face to both new and old fans alike.That being said, nothing can take away from the wild, brilliant, emotional ride that is Game of Thrones seasons 1-6, a television show that defined a decade and changed pop culture forever. I like to believe that it was cancelled after Season 6 and we never get to see the true ending ;)"
"heavenacceptme","Aug 22, 2022","10","Despite the final season, Game of Thrones remains an all time classic","You know a lot people say this about a ton of different shows but Game of Thrones is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best TV shows ever created...it's damn near perfect (except for maybe the last few episodes of the last season) and easily one of my all-time favorite shows! Yeah, the last few episodes of Season 8 weren't that good and the ending was just awful but the first 7 1/2 seasons were so amazing that it still gets a 10 from me! It's one of the rare shows where I can watch it all the way from the first episode to the last and never get bored. I'm pretty sure there's never been a show more talked about or more loved in the history of television than GOT. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is! It's absolutely amazing."
"Supermanfan-13","Dec 9, 2023","10","One of the best shows ever","Game of Thrones boasts an intricate plot with complex characters, stunning cinematography, and intense action sequences, especially its many battles and fights. It's hard to deny that it wasn't a cultural phenomenon that captivated me and many others for eight seasons.I've rated Game of Thrones a nine out of ten for its well-written and multi-layered storytelling, and its fantastic production value. However, despite still having amazing visuals and extremely high production value, like many fans, I was disappointed and to an extent frustrated by the final season's storytelling and how certain plot points were handled, which has lowered my rating from a ten to a nine. Despite this, Game of Thrones still remains for me a must-watch series and I would still highly recommend it to any fan of the fantasy or drama genre in general."
"Dan_W_Reviews","Feb 5, 2023","9","Captivating and Gripping but a Disappointing Final Season","The end ruined it all for me. It reminds me of lost, you can't judge it anymore without thinking of the ending and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends knowing how bad they handled it in the end. Wow just, wow I don't regret the ride, but I have never seen such a good show fall apart like this. I guess the checks have been cashed who cares about artistic integrity"
"tweaknhoe","May 25, 2019","8","Why just why? This show could have been the best ever.","Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"TheLittleSongbird","Nov 8, 2017","10","This is a television show?","So imagine you go into an ice cream shop and you order a sundae. They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!And then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some Dijon mustard on for good measure.You don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.That's essentially Game of Thrones. I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. There are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time I come back here I drop it one more star it seems like. Game of Thrones is a beautiful anchovy sundae."
"kunkell","Nov 1, 2019","6","Imagine an Ice Cream Shop","What can be said about Game of Thrones that hasn't already been said? It's universally thought of as one of the best series in the history of television. Look up any ""best shows ever"" list and I promise you'll find Game of Thrones near the top of every list you'll find. Obviously everyone knows the last episode was absolutely awful, even most of the actors have come out and said they didn't like it. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the show being amazing. One bad show doesn't take away from the other 72 episodes that were almost perfect! I've watched the entire series all the way through twice now and if anything I just appreciate this show even more."
"akhil-marsonya27","May 20, 2019","1","A Message to Dan and Dave","This is the first series i would recommend to anybody , it is an amazing piece of work , the most stunning TV series you will ever watch.
Why i gave it 9/10 because of the last season, it's still good but very disappointing compared to all the seasons. YOU will enjoy every episode"
"Rob1331","Nov 10, 2023","10","Amazing","Season 1-4 were practically perfect, there is not much to say. It had so many great moments, so many great episodes there. But then... well the writers kinda ran out of books to adapt. Season 5 and 6 were pretty boring most of the time. But they truly had their moments even having some of the best episodes of the show. Season 7 you could really see the dip in quality. Everything just felt so rushed most of it was really stupid. And then ofc. Season 8 the biggest disapointment I have ever seen. I have never seen anything more terrible. The ending was the stupidest thing i have ever seen. All of the characters were just so stupid. Everything felt even more rushed. And all the characters were basically ruined because of the writing. Overall i still give it a 9/10 just because of the first half of the show. And ofc it did still have its moments. I would still consider this show a masterpiece and I would 100% recomend. It is truly a must watch show."
"alshamari-marwa","May 18, 2020","9","Extraordinary untill season 8","A series like never seen before which rocked last season on a flop! congratulations anyway"
"tobiascramon","Nov 8, 2022","9","one the best shows ever made","I loved this series so much. Then came season 8 episode 3 and 4. Such a disgraceful ending.Seasons 1-4 10/10
Seasons 5-7 9/10
Season 8 (Ep 1-4) 3/10"
"adamheritage-15333","May 5, 2019","9","Can we please just restart season 8, perhaps 7 as well, but mainly 8","Started off as the greatest series of all time, but had the worst ending of all time."
"LASTRONOME","Jun 2, 2020","10","almost perfect","I was a big fan of Game of Thrones ever since it first aired on HBO. However, after waiting for two years, I (as probably also a lot of others) felt that the season didn't rise up the rest of the show. I believe the writers and producers didn't do the show justice and rushed the story. In these 6 episodes and pretty much destroyed most of the major character lines. It took 7 seasons for these complex story lines to evolve, just to be shattered in 2 episodes.
That being said, taking in consideration that season 8 is a part of GOT, I don't believe anymore that the show deserves the 9.5 stars."
"SpitOnAStranger","May 9, 2019","8","This was an 10/10 until S08E03","As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. So when I saw the preview for ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""Game of Thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone."
"psypeterson","Apr 16, 2011","10","Excellent adaptation.","Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like ""Merlin"" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this."
"el-absy","May 19, 2019","7","Great Beginning, WORST Ending!","At first I did not want to watch the series.
But once I started watching it, I couldn't stop.
It became more and more exciting from season 1-8.Great actors.I was disappointed with the end of the 8 season!"
