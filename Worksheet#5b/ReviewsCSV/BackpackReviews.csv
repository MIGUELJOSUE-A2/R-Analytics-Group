"SHRRADOO Extra Large 50L","","September 25, 2024",4.7,"QUALITY/DESCRIPTION","I am a college student that just needs to carry a lot of stuff around; this bag does it perfectly. I am actually surprised about how well made it is. There's a small pouch in the front that carries pens/pencils, a small battery pack, and has several different pouches inside as well. There's one big enough for my calculator.Three other compartments. The two are big enough for multiple notebooks to fit inside and the biggest one unzips the whole way down the bag so if you need to fit a lot in there easy but it's difficult to slide it in from the top, just unzip it all the way, place down, zip it up and you're good. There's a laptop pocket as well. There is a charging port in the side as well.Zippers and handle are great quality, there are two spots for water bottles, buckles to keep it secure. Handle is great as well. It even comes with instructions on the TSA approved lock. There are many things that I'm still discovering about the bag as I use it daily.Overall, fantastic bag, worth the price."
"SHRRADOO Extra Large 50L","Amazon Customer","November 5, 2024",4.5,"Highly recommend","Durable. Large. Many compartments. Great price. This is the second one. I only replaced the previous one because my son wanted a new one. He wore the previous one two years. He now just uses the other one for traveling. But most book bags have to be replaced yearly due to the wear and tear on them from the school year. This one looked great after 2 years. So we just bought the same one in red so he could have something different. But if you want a book bag that can survive a middle school boy. Then this is the bag for you."
"SHRRADOO Extra Large 50L","Aislinn Lightsey","April 18, 2023",4.5,"Great fit!","I needed something a lot more sturdy for traveling to and from work. I was using a regular backpack and for some reason it was super heavy, even when I didn't put that much stuff in it. in this new one, I was able to fit my laptop, several notebooks, and a think paperback textbook in the back laptop pouch. This one has a lock with pros and cons. Another reviewer mentioned it is easy to decode the lock and while i wouldn't expect it to work if I left my bag unattended, I do expect if I was traveling I wouldn't have to worry about someone slipping into my bag and grabbing my laptop without me noticing. I don't like locks that don't lock unless it's on the unlock code already, which is how this lock is, but I think most locks are like that now? I'd prefer to just click it shut and then have to put in my code to unlock it, but it's not that big of a deal.The second pouch is very roomy. I was able to fit my small purse, my nursing pack, and some additional supplies that I had for my shifts (a drink insulator, hand lotion, some thin mints lol). It also has a mesh pouch so I can keep my box of hot chocolate separate and ready for me to grab from.The next pouch I expected to be very thin, like my last bag, but I was able to stuff my winter hat and gloves, glasses case, some candy with room to spare. It reaches all the way down to the bottom of the bag.There is a little pouch on the front/top and it holds everything I usually shove into my scrub pockets without even looking like anything is in it. Underneath that one is the last half pouch. I have my surgery cap, some chargers, some extra pens, markers, highlighters, and a flat pack of gum.Both sides have additional mini-pouches and very spacious water bottle holders. On one side it comfortably fit my 30 oz metal water bottle and the other side I shoved in one of those trident gum packs that are cylindrical as well as a Starbucks ceramic mug on top of that. I only did that when I was going from my car to my house and expected to need to be super careful but it fit so well in there I found I didn't actually have to worry.The bag has a reinforced handle at the top, adjustable clips across the sides for support, and a lot of comfortable padding on the back and on the shoulder straps. I took this to work one day so far and it 100% feels better on my back (I do have chronic back issues.) It's not as though it feels lighter per se, as if I have less stuff, but it definitely feels a lot more secure and comfortable and easier to transport.Some reviews said it didn't hold up well for them and i'm hoping taking a chance on this bag wasn't a mistake. I figure any bag has a chance to rip depending on it's use. I really love it a lot so far and I do hope it lasts. One more aspect of this bag that others may appreciate is a port to plug into a portable charger, but I don't typically use those functions in backpacks.I can't speak on water resistance, though it was snowing when I was walking to my car when leaving work, and nothing inside appeared to be wet. it was light snow though, so I'd hate to steer anyone wrong in case it's awful for that, but I don't suspect it would be.My computer/phone screens made the purple look a little brighter than it really is, which made me debate getting the black one, but I'm really happy I went with purple. It's a really great shade and an overall good-looking backpack."
"SHRRADOO Extra Large 50L","Ashanti","November 10, 2024",4.5,"Affordable, Spacious, and Professional","I really like this backpack because of how much space is in it.I originally bought it as an everyday bag with the goal of being able to take my daily items with me along with being able to store essentials in the event I was out of my element.With this bag, I was able to comfortably fit a full change of clothes, two laptops, a portable monitor, mouse and keyboard, portable charger, headphones, batteries, snacks, water, and misc utensils.So far this back has held up and is durable but we will see how that holds up in the months to come.Overall, if you're a professional on the go, a student trying to pack your day, or an amateur hiker i believe this bag will comfortably take care of you!"

"DUSLANG 17 Inch Laptop","","October 12, 2024",4.6,"A surprisingly good backpack","My middle schooler needed a replacement after a name brand bag started ripping within a couple of months. This one was much cheaper, but is light years ahead in quality. The inside has a nice blue contrast to the black. She likes the different pockets/sections. It has already proven to be sturdier. My daughter is petite and needs a big bag. This one fit the bill. The straps aren’t too far apart for her, but it is an adult sized bag. After being unhappy with what I saw in stores, I took a gamble with this one.  It’s only been about six weeks, but so far, so good! It has already outlived the more expensive sports-branded bag."
"DUSLANG 17 Inch Laptop","Amazon Customer","November 22, 2024",4.5,"Great work backpack. Highly functional and lightweight","This backpack is an excellent high quality for not a ton of money. Love the pockets, style and light weight. It is a great purchase"
"DUSLANG 17 Inch Laptop","page turner","November 15, 2024",4.6,"Great, durable backpack","I've had this backpack for a year and it still looks great.  Plenty of space for my 17in laptop, plus leftover room in that pocket for another computer or tablet.  The other compartments are also roomy.  Great value for your money."
"DUSLANG 17 Inch Laptop","roland carey","October 6, 2024",4.6,"Good almost great","It's a great bag for the money.  It holds most of my stuff without any issues.  I have my work laptop and personal Chromebook in it along with all my cables, mouse, chargers, laptop power supply, etc.  It's held up extremely well in the past 6-9 months.  My biggest issue is that I wish it was slightly larger.  Stuff fits but it doesn't leave much room to spare.  I wouldn't hesitate to get another one though."
"DUSLANG 17 Inch Laptop","Pablo Garza","July 31, 2024",4.5,"I LOVE THIS BACKPACK!","I bought this backpack as a last-minute ""I need something NOW"" solution when my previous laptop bag died days before a trip.  At first I was just happy that it arrived in time, but once I opened it and started using it, I really loved it.  It easily holds my 17"" laptop, full size tablet, portfolio, chargers, glasses, water bottle, and everything else I need to bring with me when traveling.  The padding in the laptop/tablet area inside is very generous and the pockets fold the items securely.  The shoulder straps and and back pads are very comfortable.  The design is very well thought out, with a strap to attach it to rolling luggage, and an additional hidden zipper pocket in the small of your back.Really, everything about this bag is supremely well designed and executed.  I don't have a single bad thing to say about it.  And to get everything right all while costing less than $25 is absolutely absurd.  Had I seen this in person before I bought it, I would have happily paid much more for it.  My only hope is that I'll still be able to buy it when I eventually wear it out.  Hell, I might buy another one now, just to put it in the closet for when I need it in a few years.Awesome product, unbeatable price.  This thing is a solid win."

"PUMA EVERCAT CONTENDER BACKPACK","","August 16, 2024",4.7,"Fantastic Backpack","This backpack has been a great addition to my everyday use. I needed a backpack that can be used for my medical information as well as my father’s. There is plenty of space for my notebooks, pens, pencils, information, and anything I need. The straps have great padding and are very comfortable for me. The zippers work great and seem to be very durable and at the time seem to be working as expected so I am very happy and for the price makes me happy. I chose black so it is a nice and easy color to keep things simple. This is a fantastic and versatile backpack for what I need, and I recommend it for those easy tasks, journals, or medical needs!"
"PUMA EVERCAT CONTENDER BACKPACK","Amazon Customer","September 10, 2024",5,"Excellent Customer Service!","This would be the third time I've ordered the (black/gold) Puma Contender backpack in the past three or four years. However, this time, unfortunately, I was sent a (metallic blue/black) backpack. Fortunately, during the course of my purchasing from LOTSGALORE, this was the first time that this has happened.I reached out to the customer service staff, whom were prompt and courtesy. Many customer service representatives aren't as understanding and are very curt with you. I explained my situation and informed the individual I spoke with that (I had already removed the tag) from the backpack. I knew, unfortunately that this rendered a return, not possible. I suspect that I wasn't really interested in a refund as much as I was interested in allowing the business to know that they had sent me the incorrect item.Nevertheless, I and the customer service rep messaged back and forth over the course of two days. I explained that there wasn't anything wrong with the pack and after realizing, 'it's not really a big deal', that I would just keep it. I'm sure LOTSGALORE however, is aware now just to double check before any shipment leaves their warehouse. After all, nobody wants mistakes when they make a purchase. Perhaps the next customer might not be as understanding or patient.The individual I spoke with was patient, respectful and professional. They offered me a half refund. Which was completely fine. Other than this small issue, there's a reason I have purchased from LOTSGALORE three or four times already, because I love the Puma Contender Backpack and, this business is really the only one both on the Internet and in-stores that I can find this particular backpack, under $30. It's comfortable and sturdy. I always use mine when I go out both bicycling and on my sport bike. It's roomy just enough not to be too bulky. It doesn't slide around and the shoulder straps can be tightened without causing shoulder stress.Excellent product overall.But, even better Customer Service Representation. This is why, particularly, I gave 5-stars. A+"

"THE NORTH FACE Vault","","May 11, 2024",4.7,"An awesome feature rich pack that punches well above its budget pricing!","To make this review a bit easier to read (because I tend to run off at the mouth) I've broken into sections discussing the packs features...First off, though the pack's dimensions and volume are clearly available for you to learn about, the pack still seemed a bit smaller than what I was expecting. No matter though because it was able to swallow up what I'll be carrying in it with plenty of room to spare for things like a hoodie or a rain jacket. I WFH but as much as 3-4 days a week I'll leave home to work elsewhere either for a change of scenery like at a coffee shop or a cozy bookstore or simply because I have to (to meet up with coworkers at a work share space or at the main office).The main reason for this bag's existence in my life? The ability to carry a laptop and let me tell you, for me and my laptop it does it really well. So well in fact that even though I have a protective sleeve for my laptop, I don't feel the need to use it with this bag. The rear panel of the bag which is also the laptop compartment's rear panel is thickly padded, but the most important little touch? With my laptop in the compartment the laptop DOES NOT sink to the bottom of the bag and that's great. Why? Because if the laptop sunk down to the bottom of the bag then it can potentially get damaged if you're not mindful when putting your bag down on the floor/ground. The bag's laptop compartment ends a good few inches above the bottom of the bag. In the included pics are everything that I carry and will still have room to spare... all in all is a 13"" MB Pro, a 10"" Ipad Pro (2nd gen), various sketchpads (the largest of which is 9""x12""), my on the go Apple keyboard and mouse, and 3 pouches. The gray pouch measure 9""x 6""x 2"" and it houses all my art supplies (Copic and Posca markers, various pencils, erasers, sharpeners as well as a small DIY watercolor kit). The black Maxpedition pouch measures 8""x 7""x 2"" carries my ""edc"" which consists of various small hand tools, my H.A.B.A. (health and beauty aids lol) and a small first aid kit. the third and final pouch that I carry in the pack measures 9""x 6""x 2"" and that is home to a portable ssd drive, ear buds, and all the charging cables I might need for the laptop, Ipad, and the various electronic detritus that I carry.  In the front pocket I don't make use of the organizational features that the bag has (the mesh pockets and such). Instead, that's where the ""edc"" pouch lives as well as a Moleskin journal and another small container of markers and pencils). And like I've already mentioned, I still have room to spare after packing all of that.And speaking of the front pocket, this needs mentioning - the front pocket works absolutely great FOR ME, but it might not for you. Why? First the front pocket... it roughly measures 11""- 12"" across, about 10"" in height and 2"" in depth (basically fully half of the front face of the pack). Beneath the front pocket is NOTHING which means that outer face of the pack will remain flat once the front pocket is packed full but will also mean that inside the main compartment the top half of the space will be taken up by whatever is in the front pocket and there will be a gap below the front pocket in the main compartment. This works for me because aside from the laptop and sketchbooks/books that I carry, everything else with me is in a pouch. I have a pouch in the front pocket (let's call it pouch #1) and the 2 other pouches below pouch #1 in the main compartment.If you don't carry pouches like me or if you tend to carry bigger items then the space taken up by the front pocket might be a no go for you.Front pocket TL:DR - the front pocket takes up no space of its own, instead it gets its space from the main compartment. This may or may not work for you. Fortunately it works great for me.The outer side mesh pockets... though one can definitely carry at least a 12oz bottle in the side pockets, it feels to me that that's about as big as you can go (especially if the bag's main compartment is packer semi to almost full. This isn't an issue for me since tend not to carry beverages in the same bag that I carry electronic gear (ask me why I don't!! LOL)The back panel of the bag as well as the straps... Initially the straps were on the stiff side but as I use the bag more and more they seem to be softening up. The straps are made up of some kind of sturdy foam that's been laser cut to include ventilation holes and the straps are covered in a fine mesh which gives you great ventilation.The rear panel of the bag... It's made up a stiff (but comfortable) panel that allows the bag to stand on its own when placed on the ground. On either side of the panel are 2 additional panels that are made up of a foamy cushiony material (this is the part of the bag that rests against you back).  These 2 panels create a raised section of the bag allowing air flow between the 2 panels. That air flow is hard to feel if you're simply walking around, but if you're on a bicycle, scooter, or motorcycle, the additional flow of air is easy to feel and it's a welcome addition to the bag. In the past I've had bags with this feature before but they were much more expensive, anywhere from triple to quadruple the price (made by Deuter and Ortlieb), so it was a bit of surprise to find a bag with similar functionality for a fraction of the price. Only time will tell if this will last as long as my old Ortlieb.Cons? Not that I've found so far but I do wish for a couple things...Since I carry mostly flat items that don't take up too much room I wish that there were some sort suspension system that would allow to synch the bag tight. Not that I feel like the things in my bag are banging around as I move about but it would be nice for the bag and its contents to feel ""tighter"" and moved with me better. No a deal breaker by any means, just a small wish.The lashing points on the outside of the bag... I tend to not lash things on the outside of my bags because that means I'd have to also carry something with me to do lashing. Whether that be para cord, bungee cords or whatever. I simply don't have the wherewithal or headspace to deal with all that LOL so for me the lash points - though well made with heavy stitching - serve no purpose for me.The little things that I appreciate... though I don't ever see myself using it, the clip for your keys inside the zippered front pocket is a nice tough (admittedly TONS of bags have this feature) but what most bags don't hve that this bags does? The heat shrink tubing around the zipper's toggles. Heat shrink tubing is tough stuff and typically used neaten up and or prevent shorts in electrical wiring of all kinds. Whether it's on the tail end of a butt connector or covering a spliced connection, heat shrink tubing is hyper abrasion resistant and it's great little touch/design choice. The North Face logo on the front of the bag... at this pricepoint I could picture them simply printing their logo on as it's I'm sure faster and cheaper to do and most probably not many people if any would complain about that but they didn't do that. Instead, they embroidered their logo on. A small thing but it adds the quality of the bag IMO. Lastly, this may not matter to some but I love that the bag is 100% made from recycled materials.Last little thing that's worth mentioning... While deciding on whether or not to purchase this bag or not I naturally looked at most of the provided pics and colorways. That said, as far as I know there are 2 versions of this bag, an older one and a newer one. The bag that I bought (and wanted to buy) is the newer version. You can tell because it has 2 top grab handles (as opposed to the older version's single handle) as well as having the ability to stand up on its own. I mention this because in some of the pictures for some of the different colors the bag is available in, they show the 1st gen older version of this bag and in other pictures it shows the newer version of this bag. Be sure of which version you want to buy and which version that you'll actually be receiving before buying!!Overall I'm very happy with the bag especially considering its pricepoint. It looks and feels like a much more expensive bag and in this day and age that's not easy to pull off so kudos to TNF!"
"THE NORTH FACE Vault","Amazon Customer","October 3, 2024",4.3,"Quality Backpack, stylish and spacious.","My daughter loves this backpack! It's not just stylish but also incredibly spacious. She can easily fit all her books, notebooks, and even her lunchbox inside with room to spare. The well-padded handles are a game-changer; they make it much easier for her to carry all her school essentials without feeling the weight of the load. The adjustable straps also ensure a comfortable fit, no matter how much she packs. I highly recommend this backpack for kids who need to carry a lot but want to do it comfortably and in style!"

"THE NORTH FACE Vault","Sam","September 29, 2024",4.7,"Nice backpack","Great for the price. No sunglass pocket if you're looking for that. Only reason for the 4 stars is because the front zip area isn't so much a pocketed area so if there is something in there when you zip it open, it might fall out. Overall nice and light backpack. Material feels strong but light."

"THE NORTH FACE Vault","E.K","August 28, 2024",5,"THE NORTH FACE Vault Everyday Laptop Backpack - Great Backpack","Disclosure, I am a fan of the North Face brand, and I have a backpack that has been with me for over a decade, and I try every time to replace with a different model. Since the previous one is black, and the next one is black, I decided to try a different color this time.Bottom line - this backpack combines style, comfort, and practicality.

"REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical","","August 14, 2024",4.7,"Rugged and Reliable – A Must-Have for Any Adventure","I recently purchased the REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical Backpack for a hiking trip, and it quickly became my go-to gear for any outdoor adventure. This backpack is built like a tank! The material is tough and durable, with excellent stitching that holds up even under heavy loads.The large capacity is perfect for a 3-day trip, and the multiple compartments help keep everything organized. I love the MOLLE system, which allows me to attach extra pouches and gear as needed. The padding on the shoulder straps and back panel makes it surprisingly comfortable, even when fully loaded.One of the standout features is the zippers, which are heavy-duty and glide smoothly without snagging. The water resistance is also a great bonus; it kept my gear dry during a light rain shower.Overall, this tactical backpack is a fantastic investment for anyone who needs a reliable and versatile pack for hiking, camping, or any other rugged activity. It’s well worth the price, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone in need of a high-quality, durable backpack."
"REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical","Amazon Customer","September 27, 2024",2.8,"Solid performer for outdoor adventures and everyday use!","This REEBOW GEAR Tactical Backpack has been my trusty companion on recent hiking trips and even for daily commutes. It's got ample space for all my gear, and the Molle system lets me customize it with pouches for easy access. The build feels sturdy, and the straps are comfortable even when it's loaded up. The only downside is that it can get a bit bulky when fully packed, but that's to be expected with a backpack this size. Overall, I'm really impressed with the value for the price, and I'd definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a versatile and durable backpack."
"REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical","Marcus Fuqua","October 29, 2024",4.7,"REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical Backpack Exceeds Expectations! Dependable and multifunctional.","The REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical Backpack has proven to be an invaluable asset during a recent rapid excursion. This large 3-day assault pack offers impressive versatility and functionality. With ample storage space and multiple compartments, I was able to efficiently organize all my gear and essentials.The MOLLE system enhances its adaptability, allowing for customization and expansion as needed. The backpack is durable and comfortable, even when fully loaded, making it ideal for various outdoor activities. One of the standout features is the suspension system, which significantly enhances comfort while the pack is loaded and worn for extended periods. It continues to serve me well, whether I'm hiking, camping, or using it for everyday purposes. I highly recommend this tactical backpack for anyone seeking a reliable and robust solution for their needs!"
"REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical","CCintron","March 29, 2017",4.7,"Perfect bug-out bag","For the price, this ""tactical"" backpack can't be beat.  The general construction quality of this backpack rivals those of double the price.  The compartments are all well designed, and this backpack is capable of being over-stuffed to a ridiculous degree.  The shoulder straps curve inwards, and as such, seem well-positioned against a person's abdomen.The smaller version of this backpack (Military Tactical Assault Pack Backpack Army Molle Bug Out Bag Backpacks Small Rucksack for Outdoor Hiking Camping Trekking Hunting Black) has a few advantages compared to this larger version:* The hydration pouch on the smaller version is designed much better, with a dedicated zipper.  The back of the hydration pouch is the back of the backpack, and is a firm, cushioned backing.  The larger version backpack has a rear pouch that is much smaller, and uses velcro instead of a zipper.* The largest compartment on the small backpack has an access hole on the top, from which you can run a hydration tube, headphones, etc.  There is an additional access hole between the largest compartment and the hydration pouch, so that you could run hydration tubes from both the hydration pouch AND the largest compartment.  This design was very well planned.  By contrast, the large backpack has no such access hole - just a velcro strap.* There is a y-strap on the small backpack that covers the top of all three compartment layers, prevent items from falling out, and also providing additional structural support when the bag is over-stuffed.  The large backpack doesn't have this strap.* The largest compartment on the small backpack is deep enough to lay some items flat, such as ponchos, emergency blankets/tents, MREs, etc.  I was surprised at how much I could stuff in there.  By contrast, the large backpack has a large compartment that seems a tiny bit shallower, but taller and wider.The large backpack possesses the following advantages compared to the small backpack:* The large backpack, while only a few inches larger in each dimension, is capable of being over-stuffed to a ridiculous degree.  I could fit so much more in the large backpack.* The large backpack spreads out better when completely packed, and looks a little less silly than the small backpack, which has compartment layers that are successively smaller than each preceding layer.All-in-all, I've found the large backpack is perfect for a bug-out bag, while the small backpack is perfect for an EDC bag."
"REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical","Mac Family","September 27, 2024",5,"Great bag - no water bottle holder","This is a decent backpack. I used it daily and it held up great for 3 years. The main zipper finally gave out and the bag won’t close anymore. I attribute the zipper failing to the fact that this bag doesn’t have a water bottle holder, which is my only complaint about the product. Because the bag doesn’t have a water bottle holder I am forced to clip my bottle to the side of the bag. This causes the bag to sag on that side which pulls on the zipper. The only improvement to this product that I would make is to add a water bottle holder. Other than that the bag is great, storage is great. Zippers (minus the one I wore out) and straps have held up very well."

"REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical","Adam Whitcomb","July 10, 2023",5,NA,"buenos materiales, aguanta gran peso, mucho espacio buen tamaño, la calidad de los cierres sin problemas por el uso, lo compare al uso que di a otra mochila que compre que se atora los cierres a cada rato, y con esta nunca se han atorado en el uso rudo y con prisas. de capacidad le he metido 2 camaras DLRS con tres lentes y adaptadores, una camara nikon p1000 que es gigantesca, cargadores, maquina para lectura de presión anterial, PC de 15 pulgadas gamer (Legion) con su cargador que es muy choncho, mas un monton de triques mas y aun tiene espacio para mas bien acomodado, los listones que tiene a los lados te ayuda a cerrar todo bien ajustado sin que se vea guanga aunque no la llenes por completo, la verdad se ve muy bien y con personalidad. totalmente recomendado"
"REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical","Cam Good","June 5, 2023",5,NA,"One of my friends has the tan version of this, so I checked it out and was shocked when he told me it was only $60. This thing feels like it should be nearly $200. It's massive too, with my old backpack being able to snugly fit entirely within the main pocket of this one. Right now I'm using it to haul around a bunch of gear for biking, like a small-medium socket wrench set, sweater, rain coat, gloves, pliers, the works on biking trips so I'm prepared for anything, and I still have lots of room to spare. Amazing backpack, for every situation."

"THE NORTH FACE Women's","Peter","September 4, 2024",4.5,"Comfortable cute and durable, limited space","I really enjoy this product and would probably buy it again, but it doesn't have a massive amount of space. As a college student it works well for holding my laptop and some notebooks, but in highschool when I carried 3-4 binders a day plus my laptop, planner, and pencil case, I don't think it could have held all that. Also, the front pocket only has storage space on the top half of the backpack. I actually like that feature because in the larger pocket of the bag items tend to slide down, so having the front pocket be 1/2 size actually improves the weight distribution. But that is an element that reduces size. Overall by far the most comfortable and highest quality backpack I've had, but not good if you're looking for a lot of storage."

"SHRRADOO Travel Laptop Backpack","Amazon Customer","November 11, 2024",4.5,"Real Quality and Large back pack for commuting","I commute 2.5 hrs 5 days a week. I pack two meals, a laptop, my umbrella (Oregon) and a book, my kindle, plus personal care items, and still lots of room. This backpack has a combo lock built into the bag for the laptop area; the zipper toggles fit into the lock. It's just an extra deterrent when traveling, so my valuables go in that section. Zippers are heavy-duty, and so is the bag! With a coupon, I paid under $21 for the grey bag. It looks professional, packs all my important things, and has a handy USB port cord with an external power source. You supply the power pack. A pocket on the inside holds the power pack near the USB port built into the bag. I plug my phone into the USB port built into the bag's side and charge my phone or laptop. The external power pack was separate, but the bag came with a USB port built into the bag. Totally worth the price. Wide shoulder straps are adjustable. It's a super value but doesn't spare quality."

"SHRRADOO Travel Laptop Backpack","Julie S","August 25, 2024",4.8,"Great bag!","Last school year my middle school aged son had some issues with items being stolen out of his backpack.  So far this bag has proven to be discreet and secure.  It looks like a typical backpack the lock isn’t especially noticable.  He's had a couple friends try to see if they could break into it and they could not.  He likes the charger wire and all the pockets for storage.  He feels comfortable putting his personal items in the locked compartment and knows it will be hard for a thief to try to sneak things out of this bag. We attached an airtag inside for extra security. Middle School kids are rough!!**After 2 months of wear and tear by my rambunctious 13 year old this bag has held up pretty well except it's getting small holes worn into the corners. I am sure from being drug across the ground, thrown, kicked and who knows what else he can come up with.  The lock and zippers are still solid.  If you are kind to the bag I think it would last a really long time!"

"THE NORTH FACE Borealis","nope","November 23, 2024",4.6,"Unconventional Icon","I love this backpack. It looks luxury. It feels luxury. It IS a luxury backpack. And that's the problem.You could drive a beautiful 2020 Mercedes Benz S-class, renowned for its luxury and exceptional craftsmanship, to school every day. However, won't your neighbor's 1994 Ford Ranger do the same job? It'll get you there and back to school, right? It can go offroad, hold more volume, and you don't have to worry about pesky door dings. But then again, it's all about the looks.The same goes for this backpack. It's an icon, for sure. At least one in five high schoolers is going to have this. However, you're paying more for a brand than the actual conventionalism of a backpack. For half the price, you could get an Adiads Prime that'll hold more than 2x the volume this backpack could, all in a similarly comfortable package. The Adidas Prime has a front pocket that won't stick out like a botched BBL. That's a backpack you'll keep for life, from the classroom onto a glorified gym bag. Now, I must say that the padding, chest, and waist buckles make this one of the most comfortable backpacks I've owned. The massive water bottle holders and the bungee cord system allow you to hold all sorts of stuff.However, for $100, this is simply too small. So much more could be done to make it an everyday carry. And I despise that top-heavy front lip; who actually tested that and thought it was a good idea? I put a calculator, charger, glasses, and a few pencils in there, and the thing literally tips over like a water bucket at Six Flags and dumps your belongings on the ground. And God forbid you to put your headphones in there (where else do you put headphones?). Your backpack turns into an articulated dump truck, letting your payload fly out as soon as you set the bag down.Furthermore, one main pocket for $100 bucks? Were the boys at North Face scrapping for materials? Or was it just the outside that mattered? It's likely the latter. But in all seriousness,  this should have at least another storage compartment. Maybe it could be under the bungee system to support the super mom BBL that pokes out the top of this backpack.Overall, this is an unconventional beauty. It's like marrying a p*rnstar. Sure, she's beautiful, but at the end of the day, are you really going to enjoy that? I still don't know, but I paid $100, so I WILL get my use out of this thing.Thanks for reading."

"SwissGear 1900 Scansmart TSA","","October 30, 2024",4.6,"Excellent Backpack for Travel","This is an Excellent Backpack.  It is well made of high quality materials.  The body is water resistant, so keeps interior dry.  It is sturdy.  You can pack it full and padded straps are plenty strong to take the load.  It is roomy.  I can easily fit my 15"" laptop, two wool sweaters, files, notebooks, reading glasses,  and other travel accessories into the well organized pockets .  I could fit my 17"" laptop with a slight effort.  And it looks great.  The black and slate gray looks very smart - much better than the picture.  I wish I had replaced my old travel backpack much sooner."
"SwissGear 1900 Scansmart TSA","Amazon Customer","June 7, 2017",4.5,"this is one very sturdy, spacious and versatile backpack","I've had--and still have--many, many backpacks; been buying them since high school, and I buy a new one every few years. I purchased this one in part because it will fit my 17"" laptop, but also because I needed something to replace my old and ratty ""day to day"" backpack for ""urban schlepping.""  By and large, this is one very sturdy, spacious and versatile backpack, perhaps the best one I've ever bought. It arrived at my place of work with a whole bunch of other stuff I had ordered on Amazon; for the trip home, I was able to stuff my old (partially filled) backpack into it, along with two packaged tablecloths, two shower curtain liners, and several other smaller items--it all fit very easily with little packing effort expended. Two days later I fit 25 lbs of groceries into it, again with ease, and with room to spare--didn't even need the zippered side pockets, but I probably could have put another couple pounds worth of stuff in them. Both times, both trips, I found that the loaded pack rode very nicely, very comfortably near the center of my back, and that was without having yet made any adjustments to the straps. The cushioning on the back-facing side of the backpack is generous but not overly so, and yeah, the ""airflow"" feature between the two cushioned areas does seem to aid in the comfort factor. The straps are amply wide, also padded, and they have a measure of elasticity to them--near the top of each strap is a trapezoidal-shaped (2x2x3) of sturdy, ""one way"" stretch material (stretches vertically, not horizontally); when carrying the groceries, the pack didn't ""bounce around"" or anything, but the elastic acted like a shock absorber of sorts, made for flexibility in movement and kept the top of the straps from digging into my shoulders as other backpacks with heavy loads have done in the past. Overall, the main material is thick and obviously strong, the exterior front pockets are conveniently, smartly placed; the zippers are all seem very strong and reliable; and the stitching of the seams and strap connections appears to be very solidly done. When first looking at this bag, I thought I might be put off by the solid plastic handle at the top of the front compartment--never had bag with one of those--but I've already come to appreciate it: while on the subway I had to take the pack off and carry it by the handle and it allowed for a very good and solid grip, like carrying piece of luggage; also, while wearing the pack the handle doesn't interfere with my head movements at all like I thought it might--doesn't even come near my head. If I have any complaints at all, I'd say I'd prefer that the ""organizer pocket"" on the bottom front to have a bit stiffer accessory sleeve within (where you put pens and whatnot), but I'm sure I can deal with what's there, or perhaps I'll  invest in a small organizer or ""catchall"" to slip in there. Folks, this is a real good back pack; it might be overkill if you're looking for something just to carry a few light items all the time, but if you need something that will stand up to the regular (or even occasional) heavy load, or to maybe use as a carry on travel bag, this sucker is it.Just as a side note, perhaps to illustrate how sturdy this bag is:  A few days after getting the backpack, I was watching a 60 Minutes segment on ""Gorilla Doctors,"" veterinarians who traipse deep into the jungle to aid gorillas in peril. While in the field attending one anesthetized gorilla who had been snared, they show the vets unpacking their gear and medicines and whatnot . . . and the lead vet had what appeared to be this exact backpack. So, if jungle docs have confidence in this bag . . . go for it."

"SwissGear 1900 Scansmart TSA","Michael McGrady","July 24, 2013",4.5,"Big and roomy...well thought out","Bought this bag to be my main work backpack after using a a standard Ogio one, which did an OK job of carrying my stuff but always felt so heavy considering the minimal contents.  What I love about this backpack is the organization and pockets.  The ScanSmart feature is great!  I've gone through airport security so much quicker by zipping open the compartment and laying the bag on the belt with my laptop in the 'screen' side and my iPad in the facing pocket.  No hassles from TSA. No more pulling laptops or iPads out and then having to retrieve them and shove them back in while putting on shoes and belts.  It sounds like such a small thing but it makes me happy to be more efficient.  There are plenty of compartments and they can store so much stuff.  The 'main' compartment has dividers that allow you to organize your contents (I put my GoGrid in one of the slots, file folders in another.  There is also a mesh pocket that I store my MacBook Air 'brick'.  What this does is rather then sitting in the bottom of the bag and weighing it down, it sits in this suspended pocket which helps with the weight of the bag.  When I'm in a pinch and am exceeding the carryon limit, I can even get my medium sized Coach purse in so I can meet the 'two item limit'.  There are two side pockets for water bottles or a travel umbrella as well as another pocket that lays under them which the manufacturer suggests storing the power brick.  I find that if you've got a full water bottle, you probably would want to stay away from storing a bulky item in that pocket.  There's another 'kangaroo' pocket on the front of the pack to store small odds and ends.  I put my Bose noise canceling headphones in here which makes them easily accessible when I want to get to them and keeps them out of the way.  I like the heavy duty grab handle on the top of the bag which is convenient when you just need to grab and go.  There's an MP3 pocket with a headphone feed which I don't use but for those folks who do, I'm sure it's a nice feature.  The material is very high quality and heavy duty as are the zippers and clips.  It's a well thought out bag.I'm giving this 5-stars because it is such a great backpack but beware...it is VERY large and a bit on the weighty side even when empty.  I will admit that even when I've loaded it up for my daily commute on BART, it doesn't feel nearly as heavy as my previous 'trim' backpack because the ScanSmart is so well designed.  I do get comments from my co-workers who make fun of my massive backpack but I don't care because it does the trick. For my Europe vacation later this summer, this backpack will be staying home because it is way too big to be used as a daypack and we have strict size limits on what we can take on our tour (I have bought the PacSafe Metrosafe 350 which I will review after my trip).  Great product, nice pockets and organizational features."
"SwissGear 1900 Scansmart TSA","Leonardo Ovies","October 6, 2024",4.6,NA,"Bought this thinking it would be nice to not have to pull everything out of my backpack to go through security. They still had me take everything out. They didn't care that it was designed for TSA. Don't waste your money if this is what you're buying it for. It's also very big and clunky."
