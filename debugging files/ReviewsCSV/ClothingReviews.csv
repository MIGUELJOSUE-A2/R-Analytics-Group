"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Amazon Customer","November 7, 2024",4.4,"Nice shirts great price","I ordered these for my husband. The t shirts look nice, fit nice, wash well, and the colors are great. For the price the quality is good. I'd definitely purchase these again. The green and blue colors look great. They're also very soft and stretchy."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Nicole","October 5, 2024",4.4,"Great shirts!","I bought these shirts and I'm so glad I did.They are super soft and I am able to wear them to work as well as just relaxing at home.The heather colors look really good and I have received compliments on the various colors.So far the quality of them has been outstanding. No frays or lose strings at all.They fit me perfect and don't make my stomach stick out at all which is nice. The cut is also perfect and sits right at the waist. The sleeves make my arms look good without being too tight.The functionality of being able to wear them at work or at home relaxing is perfect.I'm very happy with my purchase!"
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","JS","October 18, 2024",4.5,"Great","Ok the reviews did not lie lol, these things really shrink. I ordered a large knowing they would probably shrink, when I received the shirts they fit like a XL but after a wash they fit like a medium which is fine. Good quality, comfortable and lightweight."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Brady ","September 19, 2024",4.5,"Lightweight pocket tees","These are inexpensive but Hanes makes quality stuff in my opinion. I'm the type of guy that most of my clothes wind up being work clothes sooner or later so these work out well for me. I have other brands but most are too heavy for summer use. The pocket is nice as it is slightly larger than most allowing easier access to my phone. Phone is Samsung Flip 5 with Samsung case. If I should need lightweight tees in the future I'll most likely buy these again."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","ELMac","November 20, 2024",4.4,"Absolutely perfect","These are a good reliable brand with pockets, unfortunately they are too big. I would like to exchange them for large."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Cindy Decker","November 24, 2024",4.4,"Not the Hanes quality you're used to...","I bought these for loungewear. But, being Hanes, I expected a properly made shirt. I was quite underwhelmed with the majority of shirts in my pack. The seams in the most of the arms made me think it was a pack of irregulars.  Some pockets had lining material that escaped the seams. They work for my purpose, but are not what I expect from the brand or the price. I'll look elsewhere next time."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Bought this product recently and I must say IT WAS WORTH THE BUY!!!!!","November 15, 2024",5,"Great buy!","Bought these for my hubby and he loves them. The quality,the comfort he feels and the size was just right. Planning on buying again soon. 😌"
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Steve G","November 10, 2024",5,"Buy a size up from what you wear","The reviews stating shrinkage are correct.  I wear L. But ordered XL and they fit perfectly after washing  These are a great buy.  Not the thickest material but I would not consider them thin.  Good overall quality."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","joe a","October 30, 2024",5,NA,"Look like excellent quality."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","alfredo","August 14, 2024",5,NA,"Precio por el producto es bueno."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Geri","December 28, 2023",4,NA,"I ordered these for my ""little guy"" (obviously not so little heh). He has sensory issues and loved feeling the material with his hands when we took them out to take a look, so they're soft. They're not jersey knit soft, but, definitely the softest I've felt in a cotton shirt like this. Love the color assortment in such a big pack, too! The red is a beautiful, deep red. They're a very classic Hanes product. Great shirts for the price for a not-so-little guy who maybe ruins a lot of clothes with paint and volcanoes in school! Single moms can't always afford to buy new crops of shirts every month. These are easy to clean, easy stain removal & cheap enough that I don't cry when one goes in the ""weekend pile""."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Eric M.","January 23, 2023",5,NA,"Disclosure: I bought a multipack of Fruit of the Looms before these.  I would have thought FotL would be a good quality pack -- they are not.  Like, at all.  First wash and they're already falling apart.  These though have been pretty solid so far, they're comfortable, and they're staying in one piece.  Great as an undershirt, or a summer tee with a pocket, and the price for quantity is worthwhile."
"Hanes Men's Pocket Undershirt","Glenn R.","March 7, 2022",5,NA,"Over-all I would (and will) buy these again.  They are light weight (excellent for the summer), have a nicely done neck and the pocket doesn't hang down around my belly button!  They are nice and long so tuck in and stay in.  The only downer (if you can call it that) is that they included two grey shirts and one each of the other colours.  Very good value for the money."

The stitching is solid, and the collars stay flat without curling, which is a big plus.Versatile and Practical: Whether I’m lounging at home, working out, or running errands, these T-shirts are versatile enough to suit any activity. They also work well as undershirts, providing a smooth layer under dress shirts.Great Value: The multipack offers fantastic value for money.

"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts","Amazon Customer","November 16, 2024",4.6,"True to size. Great quality","No tags on shirts, which is a simple but great positive. Great color, great quality, and the fabric feels good. True to size and the cut looks great."
"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts","Demond Lash","November 11, 2024",4.5,"Good quality for the price.","I like the different color assortments that they offer. For the price the shirts are nice and soft they seem very true to their size and are comfortable. I would say it's a medium lightweight shirt that has a little bit of stretch in it and they seem durable so far."
"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts","Greg J","October 17, 2024",4.6,"Sleeves and tail is short.","Good quality. Not itchy. The sleeves and tail were shorter than expected. The fit is tighter than needed. This is great of I were getting there for under shirts but this was too be my daily wear collection. If you are not buying for undershirts buy a size bigger. I have small and wish for medium. I'll still use them the fit isn't terrible"
"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts","2Tall","November 18, 2024",4.5,"Nice shirts","These have a nice feel and are practical being so cheap. After two washings they shrunk a small amount so keep that in mind. Have not seen colors fade but even if they did that isn’t important to me. I’ll buy more when these are past their prime."
"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts","jonathan","November 18, 2024",4.6,"Comfortable","Very comfortable shirts. The colors are great, got medium size and they fit perfectly. Material is also great quality, very versatile have used for all different kind of activities including jogging working out and every day activities. Very light weight and when wet cannot see through. I highly recommend I will be purchasing again."
"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts","Bigben","November 25, 2024",4.5,"Great daily undershirts","These shirts fit well and are not thin so they feel nice to wear as undershirts or as regular shirts. After repeated washes they do tend to shrink, so if you are normally a men's M it first comes a tad oversize for a typical M and then after a wash or two shrinks to essentially a regular size M. After repeated washes over a year or two, they do quickly fade, but as they are inexpensive can always order another pack"
"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts","Diego Jimenez","October 4, 2024",4.6,"Neck size is not consistant","Quality is a bit iffy on these. Each shirt was inspected prior to washing.  These are not preshrunk, and will go to more of the standard size when placed in dryer with warm air.Neck opening is larger than expected for the size. I have other shirts from Gildan with graphics on them and collars fit close.  The collars on these feel like I purchased a size up. Two shirts developed holes in around seams after drying. Shirts were placed on delicate cycle by themselves.Shirts are lightweight without being thin as some other brands. Overall these appear to be decent shirts. I took off a star due to the neck sizing, and the couple holes that might have been from weak threads. I mended these placed and have not had any other issues."
"Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts","Balen","November 12, 2024",4.6,NA,"Great shirts for my husband's work.Love that they fit him well. When he stretches. His belly is not out. It's hard finding proper shirts for a 6'3 man. They shrink slightly. Not alot tho. They wash and dry well. They hold up Great for my hubby who's a carpenter. Not sure his weight. But he's 6'3 and I get him a XXL. Perfect size after washing and dryer. Very soft and comfortable he says."

"Fruit of the Loom","Amazon Customer","November 4, 2024",4.6,"Holds up well after many washings","These Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Stay Tucked Crew T-shirts are an excellent value! They’re super comfortable, with a soft, lightweight fabric that feels great against the skin and stays breathable throughout the day. The stay-tucked design is a real game-changer—no more constantly adjusting or worrying about the shirt riding up. It stays neatly in place, which makes it ideal for layering under dress shirts or wearing on its own.Style-wise, these shirts have a classic look that works for just about anything, whether I’m wearing them casually or as an undershirt. They hold up well in the wash, too; no noticeable shrinking or loss of softness, even after multiple washes. For the price, these are a fantastic deal. They’ve quickly become a staple in my wardrobe, and I’ll definitely be buying more. Highly recommend these for anyone looking for a simple, comfortable, and stylish basic tee!"
"Fruit of the Loom","Jenn Noble","November 22, 2024",4.6,"Comfortable","Great price, not extremely lightweight but not heavy either. The fit is perfect. You can’t see through the shirts so they do have a little weight to them. The colors are good and do not fade with washing. Worn under a sweatshirt they do help keep you warm. For the price I believe these shirts are excellent quality. Fast shipping as well."
"Fruit of the Loom","Charlotte ","November 21, 2024",4.4,"Tough T shirts ""Vibrant Comfort: The Perfect T-Shirt!""","Gilden colored t-shirts are fantastic! The fabric is soft, comfortable, and holds its vibrant color well after multiple washes. With a great variety of sizes and colors, they fit perfectly and are perfect for casual wear or events. Highly recommend for anyone looking for quality t-shirts! Five stars! 🌟"

"Fruit of the Loom","Bruce Wayne","November 13, 2024",3.3,"Very nice","They are huge for xl but maybe because they haven't been washed yet. Nice and soft though."
"Fruit of the Loom","Super fast delivery ","November 3, 2024",4.6,"Very nice t-shirts!","Easily the most comfortable t-shirts I have purchased to date. I absolutely love the way they fit.

"Fruit of the Loom","Nilo","October 18, 2024",4.6,NA,"""Love this T-shirt! The fabric is ultra-soft and comfortable. The fit is spot-on, not too tight or too loose.

A staple in my wardrobe. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great addition to their clothing collection."" 🌟"
"Fruit of the Loom","Kush Sakariya","September 20, 2024",4.6,NA,"Las playeras muy cómodas y la talla es exacta, lo único es que la manga viene un poco mas corta, pero solo un poco, pero para mi no es problema, muy frescas y suaves, recomendables para andar en casa, saludos!"
"Fruit of the Loom","David","July 22, 2024",4.6,NA,"Exactly as described! Fit perfect and really nice and soft."
"Fruit of the Loom","DAN STEEL","July 7, 2024",5,NA,"These are decent shirts that appear well made and they are reasonably soft and comfortable. The shirts also don't weight less than most shirts I've ordered. As someone with sensitive skin, I like that they are not heavy. They also aren't itchy which is also a bonus. After the first wash there isn't a sign of fraying at the seams with the stitching and seems to be holding up.They fit true to size for me, I bought the 3XL and they only shrink minorly in length. But that is to be expected.Overall these shirts are in my opinion a great value for what you get. Fruit of the Loom is a great brand and have bought them before. the quality I have received has been superb each and every time."

"Gildan Unisex Adult Ultra","","July 8, 2018",4.5,"Solid value T-shirts","I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8"" and 140"", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer.  Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out.  I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8"" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however,  I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on ""energy saving"", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them.  They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.November 28, 2020 -  I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.September 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling."
"Gildan Unisex Adult Ultra","Amazon Customer","October 30, 2024",4.5,"Good Quality, Breathable, Great Value","I got these t-shirts for work. I like these because they’re nice and breathable. I work in the back kitchen area and it gets really hot. I like that these came in a 2-pack and it’s very affordable. I truly appreciated this since at the time I didn’t have a job and my work doesn’t pay for our uniforms. They fit me just fine. For reference I am 5’3” and 135 lbs."
"Gildan Unisex Adult Ultra","Solomon Kane","September 28, 2024",4.3,"Good quality shirts!","I recently purchased the Gildan Unisex-Adult Ultra Cotton T-Shirt, Style G2000, in a multipack, and I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and comfort of these shirts! The 100% cotton fabric is incredibly soft and breathable, making it perfect for everyday wear.The fit is just right – not too tight and not too loose – and it suits both men and women perfectly. I also appreciate the durability of these shirts; they hold up well after multiple washes without losing their shape or color. The variety of colors available in the multipack is a great bonus, allowing me to mix and match with different outfits.Overall, the Gildan Ultra Cotton T-Shirts have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, fit, and durability. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for high-quality, versatile t-shirts at a great value!"
"Gildan Unisex Adult Ultra","Boopboopbeepboop","August 15, 2024",4,"Great","I purchased the pack of 3 Gildan Unisex-Adult Ultra Cotton T-Shirts, Style G2000, at an incredible discount. I was pleasantly surprised to receive the package within 24 hours of placing the order. I found that the XL size gave me the perfect loose fit that I prefer in my T-shirts. Even after multiple washes, the T-shirts still retained their shape with minimal shrinkage, which was impressive. The black color I chose was made of thick, high-quality material that felt incredibly comfortable. However, I did notice some slight fading after several washes, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, if you're looking for a comfortable, thick T-shirt with good quality, this one is a great choice. I would suggest going for a lighter color since the fading is more noticeable in darker shades."
"Gildan Unisex Adult Ultra","Bryan","November 11, 2024",4.6,"Great Value for quality shirts","The shirts are the perfect thickness, cotton content, true to size, very flattering with great stretchiness.  Love the color and shirts."

"Gildan Unisex Adult Ultra","you should have this game is over the top","November 18, 2024",4.5,"Runs true to size","Curvy 156-158 lbs. 5’  bought a small returned too small and exchanged for a medium fit perfect, can’t dry it could have also worn a large washed and dried.Color was very bright for a red. The material is not stretchy and does not give much. If you are between sizes and want some room go up to the large if you want to be able to wash and dry. If you are someone who washes and air dries you could get away with a medium if you like your shirts close fitting. These shirts are true to size. Not soft cotton but do the job for the price for a work shirt."

"Hanes Men's Cotton Moisture-Wicking","","November 16, 2024",4.5,"Solid material and reliable","Good for undershirts or work shirts. Great price. Comfy fabric. True to size!"
"Hanes Men's Cotton Moisture-Wicking","Amazon Customer","November 22, 2024",4.5,"My husband has worn this brand for years","Great fit, quality and comfort. They don’t shrink that much and hold up well. We’ve bought these MANY times over the years. He’s tried different brands and always goes back to these."
"Hanes Men's Cotton Moisture-Wicking","Christine O.","August 25, 2024",4.5,"Hanes Vs. Fruit of the Loom Undershirts","This review is for those of you trying to decide between the Hanes vs. Fruit of the Loom undershirts.Overall, I have to go with Hanes because the neck hole feels more appropriate. Fruit of the Loom is just too large. At the end of the day, the hole will stretch out and show chest hair popping up in the front, and back hair from the back.If the goal is to wear an undershirt for work with a business casual dress shirt (top button open / no tie) I don't want my chest cleavage showing; otherwise I'd get a V-neck.The Hanes shirt is thinner and cooler. BUT, it's also a bit more rough / scratchy. Not in a bad way, but Fruit of the Loom feels super soft in comparison.I'll also mention that after one wear I started noticing threads coming out of the arm seams on the Hanes, whereas Fruit of the Loom have gone through multiple washes and are still as durable as the day I got them. The Hanes haven't fallen apart by any means, but it's something to point out.Both a 2X Hanes and 2XL Fruit of the Loom seem to be the same length.  I have a big gut, so I was worried not having the ""[L]ong"" affix for a size option for Hanes meant they would be too short and hard to tuck into my pants, but they tuck great even after washing.Both are great options tbh.  In summary -Hanes for:- Smaller neck- Cooler / lighter fitFruit of the Loom for:- Softer / warmer fit- More durability"
"Hanes Men's Cotton Moisture-Wicking","Adam","November 7, 2024",4.3,"Fits comfortable and breathable material","These tee shirts are thin, but they do what they are supposed to do. I got the 3x size and use them for sleepwear. The material is breathable and feels comfortable on my skin."
"Hanes Men's Cotton Moisture-Wicking","H. Sullivan","October 23, 2024",4.3,"Great Undershirt","Thin, breathable, comfortable, and stylish. This is a great exercise shirt and I love the feel of the fabric. It's also a great home/night shirt. The only complain I have is that there was some small fraying in the material when I initially got the shirts which is a little weird since its so new. Besides that it works great, no tears yet."

"Hanes Men's Cotton Moisture-Wicking","Mrs. Jassical McCullough ","November 13, 2024",4.5,"Ok, but quality has definitely diminished over the years","I’m 5’ 10” and 150lbs and I ordered medium. The size and fit are good. Be aware, these are a little long so they can be tucked in your pants. That being said, you have to be careful how you dry these after a wash. Personally, I use a drying cycle that minimizes the shrinking. As for the quality, it’s acceptable. These are thin, and they aren’t the soft kind of cotton undershirt. In fact, they kinda have a rough texture, that cheap undershirt feeling. The quality of these Hanes undershirts use to be so much better back in the day. They use to be thicker, softer, and cheaper. Get these on sale or at a discount like I did, and you’ll be much happier with the purchase."

"Hanes Men's T-Shirt Beefy-T","","October 24, 2024",4.5,"Heavy-Duty Comfort That Lasts","The Hanes Beefy-T is a solid choice when you need a t-shirt that can handle real work. It’s made with thick 6-ounce ringspun cotton that feels substantial but still soft against the skin. The weight is perfect—it’s not flimsy like some lighter shirts out there. It can take a beating, whether I’m working, layering it under a jacket, or just wearing it on its own.The fit is spot on—comfortable with a bit of room to move, but not too loose. It’s got a good length that stays in place, and the ribbed collar keeps its shape even after lots of washes. I like having a few white ones in my rotation because they’re a classic staple, and this one holds up well, wash after wash.For the price, it’s hard to beat. It’s the kind of shirt that feels like it should cost more but doesn’t. If you’re looking for a tough, reliable t-shirt that won’t let you down, this is the one. Highly recommend for anyone who needs a durable go-to tee."
"Hanes Men's T-Shirt Beefy-T","Amazon Customer","April 30, 2024",4.5,"Fresh Out of the Box: My Take on the Hanes Beefy T-Shirt","Purchased: 04/26/2024- **Material:** 100% Heavyweight Cotton- **Pack Options:** Available in 1 or 2 packs- **Sizes:** Includes regular and tall sizes- **Colors:** Multiple color optionsI just started wearing my new Hanes Beefy T-shirt and felt compelled to share my first impressions about this iconic piece of casual wear. Known for its heavyweight cotton, this tee promises durability and comfort, and so far, it’s living up to the hype.**Initial Thoughts on Quality and Comfort**Right from the start, the quality of the fabric stood out. The cotton is noticeably thick, which I appreciate because it feels like it can withstand the wear and tear of daily life. The comfort level is exactly what you would hope for in a casual tee – soft on the skin with a fit that feels tailored but not tight.**Wearing Experience**- **Thickness and Fabric:** The thickness of the T-shirt is perfect for cooler days without being too bulky, making it a great all-season wear. The fabric is breathable, which is a plus.- **Fit and Shrinkage:** I’ve only washed it once, but so far, there’s been minimal shrinkage, which is often a concern with cotton tees. It fits true to size, and the availability of tall sizes is a bonus for those who need a bit more length.- **Color and Value:** I opted for a classic gray, and the color was true to what was advertised. Considering the quality and feel, the value for money seems very good.**Overall Impressions**The Hanes Beefy T-shirt ticks all the boxes for a reliable, everyday T-shirt. It’s sturdy yet comfortable, and the fit is just right—neither too loose nor too constrictive. Whether you’re out for a casual meet-up or just lounging at home, this T-shirt serves the purpose well.**Specs Recap:**- **100% Heavyweight Cotton:** Durable and soft.- **Minimal Shrinkage:** Holds its shape and size after washing.- **True to Size Fit:** Comfortably fits without being too tight or too loose.I recommend the Hanes Beefy T-shirt if you’re looking for a high-quality, comfortable, and durable tee. It offers great value and comes in a variety of sizes and colors to suit different preferences and needs. Definitely a solid addition to any wardrobe!"

Other 'talls' claim to do so and don't. Very disappointing. This was a 2-pack, a good deal. They are high quality heavy duty shirts great for NY State in Fall, Winter or Spring...and fine in the Summer if you don't like covers.  I'm under 6' and only a few pounds overweight, old enough that my broad shoulders are a little smaller now. The X-Large is perfect. Not tight and not too baggy. It falls to mid-thigh when I stand, but here's the secret: wash in cold or warm water only and do not use the drier. I stretch it holding top and bottom then pull sideways against wrinkles and let dry on a hanger. It looks great every time. My last one didn't lose shape until nearly 4 years.  Highly recommended."

The only issue I have is the sizing. I hate tight clothes, so I always get size 2XL, which leaves me plenty of room. I ordered these in 2XL and they are not as roomy. So if you’re like me and like to have some room in your shirt, consider getting a size larger than you normally wear.

"MCPORO Workout Shirts for","Brian Frayne","September 1, 2022",4.4,"More than workout shirts","While these are labeled as workout shirts I think perhaps they are a bit dressy for that, in fact they are quite a bit dressier than my usual pick of all cotton tee shirt, the brand that has tens of thousands of reviews here. These aren’t quite as popular but they should be, they are better made and about the same price per shirt if you buy the multipacks with five shirts in them. And the biggest thing they have going for them is the incredible choice of colors, although I would suggest to them that they should try to stay away from including so many of the dull dark colors, today’s active man doesn’t dress like his grandfather, bright colors are very popular now.The material isn’t like most casual tee shirts, it is a shiny slick manmade material that on close inspection looks like it is knit like a very thin sweater.WHAT I LIKETopping the list of likes are the great bright colors that stay bright wash after wash. They don’t shrink either and they are true to U.S. men’s sizes.  That makes them easy to buy.  They feel great and don’t show wrinkles.NOT SO POSITIVEThere is nothing that I dislike about these but there are a few things you should know. One is that they are fairly thin. That coupled with the shiny texture makes them reveal everything including the nips. They also look too expensive and dressy to wear casually around the house, like mowing the lawn for example. Like I said, not a negative just something to be aware of. If you live in a hot climate as I do these are absolutely wonderfully cool and lightweight feeling.YES OR NOAfter getting ready to order my usual brand and being disappointed that their shades are so boring I searched and was amazed how many choices there were. I landed on these because of the huge range of colors available. Once I saw the price (especially for the multi-paks) I was hooked. These are one of the best values around."

"Champion Men's Classic Long","RAUL","October 29, 2023",5,NA,"These days, clothing quality has been going downhill. Every brand is trying to sell you ""Performance"" shirts made of polyester, which is just a fancy word for cheap plastic. Nothing compares to the comfort and warmth that you can only achieve with real cotton clothing. I'm a fan of Champion because they are one of the few companies still making quality cotton clothing.I typically wear Small in 99% of clothing brands, but Champion clothing always runs smaller for me. I got medium and it fits perfectly."
