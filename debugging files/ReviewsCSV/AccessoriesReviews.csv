"ESR for iPhone 14","","November 14, 2024",4.6,"Case is perfect","This case is absolutely perfect. Because it was inexpensive I was concerned about its quality. Do not be alarmed, this product is great and has held up so incredibly well. I have dropped my phone numerous times and it hasn‚Äôt cracked and it has held up. The purple color that I received was exactly as the photo showed and is beautiful. I really enjoy the feel of the case as it has just a slight grip to it, which makes it easier to hold onto the phone. I would absolutely recommend this if you are looking for a new case for your phone. I will continue to buy this going forward if I ever need to replace this one. While it popped on to the phone easily, it stays in place and is also easy to remove when you apply pressure. I like that because I can remove it and then clean the phone when it gets dirty. I purchased a separate kickstand for it and it latches on incredibly tight and you have to slide it in order to remove it. Would highly recommend."
"ESR for iPhone 14","Amazon Customer","November 6, 2024",4.4,"Sleek, Clear, and Comfortable ‚Äì Perfect Fit for iPhone 16 Pro Max","This ESR case for the iPhone 16 Pro Max is fantastic! It was incredibly easy to put on, and the clear design allows the phone‚Äôs color and style to shine through while adding a layer of sturdy protection. The case feels very sleek and smooth in the hand, providing a comfortable grip without being too bulky.The MagSafe compatibility is a nice bonus, making it convenient for charging and using accessories without removing the case. Overall, it‚Äôs a great balance of style and function, and I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase. Highly recommended for anyone looking to protect their phone in style!"
"ESR for iPhone 14","jamie","November 12, 2024",4.5,"Very Powerful Magnet","The case overall feels very solid. It has very bezels around the case, providing a very good lift for screen protection for what it‚Äôs faced down. In addition, the MagSafe magnet on the back is very powerful and provides an extreme grip to other MagSafe products. For example, I have a Anker MagSafe 10,000 mA/h portable battery that had a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù grip on the phone itself with no case. However, if I gave it a good shake, the battery would just fly off. But with this case on, I can shake my phone, hard, and the battery will not even budge.Very good product."
"ESR for iPhone 14","Robert Fernandez","November 26, 2024",4.4,"Good Case","I needed a new case and decided on this one after I read the reviews. This case works perfect with the Clutch Pro. This case is very easy to use, simply place your phone inside and snap or push the sides to ensure the case is snug. I purchased the purple colored case, and it looks good. Great phone case, great value for the money, it‚Äôs not bulky, and I can access the side buttons easily."
"ESR for iPhone 14","Randy","October 8, 2024",4.3,"Great Protection with Sleek Design and MagSafe Compatibility","The ESR Classic Hybrid Case for iPhone 16 Pro Max offers a great balance of protection and MagSafe functionality. I‚Äôve been using it for a few weeks now, and overall, I‚Äôm quite impressed with the design and build quality. The clear back allows the beauty of the iPhone 16 Pro Max to shine through while providing military-grade shockproof protection, which gives me peace of mind when I accidentally drop my phone.The case fits snugly, ensuring that all buttons and ports are easily accessible. It doesn‚Äôt add too much bulk to the phone, which is a big plus for me since I prefer a slim, minimalist profile. The raised edges around the screen and camera offer extra protection, and the clear material hasn‚Äôt yellowed yet, which is often a problem with clear cases.MagSafe compatibility is another highlight. The HaloLock magnetic feature is strong and works perfectly with my MagSafe charger and other accessories. The magnetic connection is reliable, and my phone charges quickly without having to adjust the position.However, one minor issue I‚Äôve noticed is that the case can become slightly slippery, especially when my hands are wet or sweaty. Also, while the case offers good drop protection, it doesn't feel as rugged as some heavy-duty cases. But if you‚Äôre looking for a protective yet stylish case that shows off your iPhone's design, this ESR case is a solid choice.Overall, it‚Äôs a great case with a few minor drawbacks. Four stars!"
"ESR for iPhone 14","Gwen","November 12, 2024",4.6,"Great phone case.","This was a great value for the money and it‚Äôs well designed. It has a nice feel in your hand and  fits perfectly on the phone. Bought it for iPhone 16 Pro. Don‚Äôt have any of the magnetic accessories for it, but it still works if you lay it flat on a charging pad that is not magnetic.."

"BENTOBEN Magnetic for iPhone","","July 11, 2024",4.5,"Good case for the money","I cannot attest to the some of the features as I haven‚Äôt dropped it & I don‚Äôt have any magnetic accessories. But overall this feels like a good case. When I first opened it I thought it looked cheap but it was cheap. After putting it on my phone it‚Äôs really cute & feels good & looks nice.  It has a good grip to it making it easy to hold on to. It feels like thick silicone. The raised edges feel like it would protect it if you drop it. ü§û  I am unsure why the frame for the camera says 100 pixels because it‚Äôs just a frame. It does feel like metal. The case fits my iPhone 13 very snug & secure. The buttons feel like plastic but are responsive & work well. My pop socket works well on it. Overall it‚Äôs a good case for the money & I would recommend it."
"BENTOBEN Magnetic for iPhone","Amazon Customer","November 23, 2024",4.3,"Looks nice and feels great","this is a really nice phone case for the price good fill in the hand easy to get in and out of your pocket and the higher lip provides solid protection for the screen"
"BENTOBEN Magnetic for iPhone","Lorri","November 17, 2024",4.6,"Good case","Love the color and it‚Äôs holding up well. Have dropped my phone numerous times and the case has protected it. Would buy again."
"BENTOBEN Magnetic for iPhone","Justin P","October 15, 2024",4.5,"So Cute","this phone case is great! I love that the buttons are made from a different material and are easy to find without looking. The color is slightly different and much more pink in person than depicted but is is still beautiful. It is very slim and does not hinder getting my phone in and out of my pocket. It also works great with the magnetic popsocket I purchased to go along with it."
"BENTOBEN Magnetic for iPhone","MoMo","November 5, 2024",4.6,"Great Value","This case was a perfect fit, looks good and came with two screen protectors for a great price."
"BENTOBEN Magnetic for iPhone","SBWhillock","November 6, 2024",4.6,"Song fit, strong magnet","Overall 5/5 for functioning as intended.The case fits perfect, is snug to the device, and easy to put on and take off. The magnet is very strong and allows for unimpeded charging on my magnetic car charger. I wish it came in solid colors as well, but I like the metal bevel around the camera. Although the bevel does add a lot of thickness so the phone does not lay flat when face up. The case is a bit too smooth for me and slips out of my fingers but case add-on‚Äôs affect the phone‚Äôs charging ability and thickness."
"BENTOBEN Magnetic for iPhone","Christopher Colon","October 7, 2024",4.5,"Love it!!!","This case protects the phone very good! The functionality of it is great. It is MagSafe so you can use it in those chargers which I love! The case seems to be scratch resistant. I havent gotten any scratches on mine. Slimness is great. It isn‚Äôt big and bulky. It slides in and out of my pocket great. Installation is pretty easy. It just pops on and off. However it does stay on good. It‚Äôs a very durable case. My phone does not do fingerprints. However the case does not interfere with any part of the screen so I would assume you would have no problem."
"BENTOBEN Magnetic for iPhone","Alexis Palermo","October 19, 2024",4.6,"Very pretty but did not hold up","The color was bright and beautiful! However, within 2 months of use, the cover lost its bright color and appeared dirty. Attempted to clean with dish soap and then alcohol pad but nothing helped. I ended up throwing it away :("

"OtterBox iPhone 15 iPhone","Amazon Customer","October 23, 2024",4.5,"This is a very nice phone case.","Very strong and durable phone case. Worth the money."
"OtterBox iPhone 15 iPhone","Douglas R. Lipman","March 23, 2024",4.6,"Perfect Protection","I drop my phone a million times a day. Sometimes it lands on the screen, sometimes on its back. Otterbox had been the only phone case brand I have ever used. Since the first iPhone, the brand stands agains the rest.This specific style, its sleek, clean look. I got the black color as it aligns with the color of my phone. The fit to the iPhone is slick, does not extend the the size of the phone by much, so you can still fit it into standard sized pockets and purses."

"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","","November 7, 2024",4.6,"I love these cases","I have NEVER EVER had a cracked screen, broken lens on the phone‚Äôs camera, or a cracked phone case EVER. This is the only case I will use on my iPhones and iPads. It has grips in all the right places but easily slips in my pockets. I have 2 small children and they are constantly dropping my devices but this case stands the test! Well worth the price."
"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","Amazon Customer","July 9, 2024",4.6,"Amazing price for the great protection and style of an Otterbox case.","I loved the simple design and protection of the cover.  I bought the blue one for myself and the pink one for my wife. I didn‚Äôt even wait for one to come in before ordering the other one since it felt like a great deal. It‚Äôs a nice and sleek design. It fits like a glove on my iPhone 13 Pro Max. It has a smooth back for ease of putting and taking out of pocket. I like that it has rubber grip areas at the right spots to help with holding it securely and ensuring it doesn‚Äôt slide so easily on a flat surface.  I‚Äôm very happy with my purchase."
"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","Jennifer Pringle","October 23, 2024",4.7,"Great quality","Phone Case fit snug and correctly. No scratches, marks or damage. Feels great in your hands ! I love that there is a cover for the charging port. I don‚Äôt think this will have MagSafe charging since the case is so thick. Great buy if you are a serial dropper like I am."
"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","Luis","October 14, 2024",4.6,"So durable","I absolutely love OtterBox. I have had a few different ones, and since then, I have not broken an iPhone. These cases are a great value for the price and are so durable!! I like the color black and it‚Äôs a good black color. It is very user-friendly to hold and very easy to install. I love this case!!!"
"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","Brette lawrence","September 13, 2024",4.6,"Otterbox cases are solid.","Otterbox cases are very durable and protect well. They‚Äôre a little more expensive, but worth the money. I like the commuter series because they have the two pieces. There‚Äôs a rubber case and then a hard plastic pieces that snaps on the back. It has a port cover and grips by the buttons and on the back. The back is slightly slippery, but I haven‚Äôt had an issue since it has the grips. It keeps my phone clean and my charging port. The back is open for the camera so you can have the lens protector on with the case. All in all, great solid case."
"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","jvazquez","October 1, 2024",4.6,"Love these Otterbox cases","This is the second of this case that I've purchased for my iPhone 13 Pro Max.  The first one was the black and this is the blue.  I really like the size and feel of this case.  It doesn't feel overly bulky and it has side grips so it doesn't feel like it's in danger of slipping out of your hand.  The first one lasted about 3 years when it started to crack horizontally.  I don't think this is a failing of the case since I have a nervous habit of slipping the corner of the case on and off of the phone.  I also like the little cover over the port on the bottom that keeps dust and dirt out.There's not a whole lot more to say about this case.  It protects the phone, looks nice, and keeps it from slipping out of your hand.  The only thing that might be a negative is that I do have to position it just perfectly on my wireless charger or it doesn't charge but that's so minor, I almost don't mention it.Highly recommend."
"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","Alexander Vieths","November 17, 2024",4.7,"Objectively good quality","The case will protect your phone from all kinds of damage from drops, even if it falls screen first since the case protrudes outward a bit to absorb the shock instead of the screen. Some of the preference issues you may have is that it‚Äôs bulky compared to some other cases, but I really like the feel of it. It comes on and off easily, having two pieces. Easily washable if needed, overall really good if you‚Äôre worried about phone drop damage."
"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","Josh Ferguson","July 28, 2024",4.4,"Love this one better than my last Ottorbox","Love Ottor Box, and this one is simple. Used to buy Athena whole kit, including belt hook and top frame. The top frames break, and never used the belt hook, so this on is perfect! Tough and light! Grips easily, verses the non otter box, brand I used just before this one. I‚Äôd get hand marks from the grip of the old brand. This never leaves marks redness or indents. I still need to check it with my car window charger, but it‚Äôs Ottor Box!!"
"OtterBox iPhone 13 Pro","TobySauce","August 5, 2024",4.6,NA,"I ordered three for my sons and I. The quality is great and is expected for the price and the otter box name. If you want something that isn‚Äôt too bulky of a case but is still pretty protective. This is it!"

Then this Ornarto pearl of a silicone iPhone 13 cover arrived and I was immediately impressed with the quality, non-slip, durable silicone material.

Anywho, this silicone case is so soft in my hands, easy to clean, and the baby pink is just a perfect color for me. I have a camera lens protector on my phone and the phone case is level with the camera lens protector (if that makes sense). This case is just right for me. Very satisfied."

"Temdan for iPhone 16","","November 24, 2024",4.6,"Perfect Clear Phone Case!","I absolutely love this clear phone case! It strikes the perfect balance between protection and style, letting the beauty of my phone shine through while keeping it safe.The fit is flawless‚Äîit hugs my phone snugly without feeling bulky. All the buttons and ports are easily accessible, and the cutouts are perfectly aligned. The quality is excellent; the material feels durable yet lightweight, and it hasn‚Äôt yellowed or scratched, even after weeks of use.What really impressed me is the grip. The case has a smooth finish but still provides just the right amount of texture to prevent accidental drops. And speaking of protection, it does a fantastic job! The raised edges around the screen and camera give me peace of mind, knowing my phone is safe from minor bumps and scratches.I also love how this case doesn‚Äôt add unnecessary bulk‚Äîit keeps my phone sleek and easy to handle. Plus, it‚Äôs super easy to clean and looks brand new with just a quick wipe.If you‚Äôre looking for a clear phone case that‚Äôs stylish, functional, and protective, this one is a no-brainer. Highly recommend!"
"Temdan for iPhone 16","Amazon Customer","November 6, 2024",4.5,"Sturdy and Stylish Case for My Pink iPhone!","I‚Äôm so happy with the Temdan for iPhone 16 Plus Case! The clear design lets the pink color of my iPhone shine through beautifully, and the case itself feels very sturdy and well-made. I‚Äôve dropped my phone a couple of times, and this case has definitely held up, giving me peace of mind about its durability. The MagSafe component works great too!The button covers are also a nice touch‚Äîthey‚Äôre easy to press and responsive, unlike other cases that make the buttons hard to use. I haven‚Äôt noticed any yellowing yet, but if that changes, I‚Äôll be sure to update. Overall, this case is perfect for anyone who wants reliable protection while showing off their phone‚Äôs color!"
"Temdan for iPhone 16","Kristen67","October 28, 2024",4.6,"Equivalent to the Apple MagSafe case, but cheaper","This is a great, simple and quality clear MagSafe case.

"Temdan for iPhone 16","Hailie","November 11, 2024",4.6,"Awesome price per value","Great product for the price. One of my button edges is a little pokey (not a perfect cut so it‚Äôs not smooth on the edge of the button), but other than that the case is good. Another feature that is dumb is the lanyard and bump + holes for the lanyard, wish it didn‚Äôt have that as I don‚Äôt plan to attach the wrist strap"
"Temdan for iPhone 16","Mike J","October 10, 2024",4.5,"I don't usually leave reviews...","I recently purchased the iPhone 16 Pro, and I wasn't keen on spending over $40 for a case, especially since I'm not fond of them. This case caught my eye because it looks almost identical to the ones sold at Apple Stores. I had Apple cases for my iPhone 14 Pro Max, and they performed well‚Äîdespite numerous drops, my phone remained scratch and crack-free.While I haven't tested this new case with drops (and I don't plan to intentionally!), the quality seems identical to Apple's cases at a fraction of the price. The MagSafe functionality works perfectly, the fit is spot-on, and the overall quality is impressive. I highly recommend it!"
"Temdan for iPhone 16","Eric C.","November 7, 2024",4.6,"Minimalist","Pros:Sleek Design: The transparent material showcases the phone's original design while offering a subtle protective layer.Lightweight: It‚Äôs slim and doesn‚Äôt add bulk to the phone.Good Protection: Despite its slim profile, it offers decent protection against scratches, and bumps, especially with slightly raised edges around the back camera.Cons:Limited Drop Protection: While it provides basic protection, it may not be enough for heavy drops or extreme impacts.Grip: The smooth plastic surface can be slippery at times, so it may not offer the best grip.Overall: It‚Äôs a great option for anyone who wants to preserve the look of their phone while offering basic protection. Perfect for those who prefer minimalistic accessories."
"Temdan for iPhone 16","Cliente Amazon","October 14, 2024",4.6,"Sturdy Design, and Great Value‚ÄîSolid Case So Far!","ve had this case for about a week and a half, and so far, I like it. The magnet is strong, so I‚Äôm not worried about my phone falling off the charger. It hasn‚Äôt yellowed yet, but time will tell on that. The case feels sturdy, and the edges are higher than the camera lenses, which helps protect against scratches. Overall, it's a good case for the price."
"Temdan for iPhone 16","Beingbeatriz","October 8, 2024",4.6,"Surprisingly nice at a very low cost","I bought this case so I would have something to put my new iphone immediately after it arrived. My plan was to buy a much more expensive case eventually. I have bought low cost cases on amazon before for other phones and was never impressed.  I have been using this case for about 3 weeks now and am happy with it. It fits the phone well, the raised edges protect the screen and also the camera on the back. The buttons work well and have a nice feel to them. I bought an Otterbox slim case but returned it because at about 5x the cost of this one, it looked and performed pretty much the same. I am not saying this is the perfect case, but the value for the money is really great."

"Temdan for iPhone 16","Jon S.","October 21, 2024",4.4,NA,"Unlike other TPU cases I‚Äôve used, this one strangely does not have a raised bevel at the TPU back of the case, only at the front. I would assume this compromises on the case‚Äôs impact absorption ability if the phone drops and lands on its back - another reviewer mentioned the back of her phone was smashed when dropped with the case fitted. The lack of raised bevel at the back also makes it harder to hold."

"OtterBox iPhone 11 Commuter","Juan Posada","July 30, 2024",4.7,NA,"The OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 11 in Black is a top-notch choice for anyone seeking a balance between robust protection and sleek design. Having used this case for a few weeks now, I am thoroughly impressed by its performance and aesthetics.Design and Build Quality:The first thing that caught my attention was the elegant and minimalist design. The black color exudes a professional look, making it suitable for both business and casual settings. The case is slim and lightweight, which means it doesn't add unnecessary bulk to the phone. Despite its slim profile, the build quality is outstanding, with a sturdy construction that feels solid in hand.Protection:OtterBox is renowned for its protective cases, and the Commuter Series is no exception. This case offers dual-layer protection, with a soft inner layer to absorb shocks and a hard outer shell to shield against drops and scratches. I accidentally dropped my phone a couple of times, and the case absorbed the impact exceptionally well, leaving my iPhone 11 unscathed. The raised edges around the screen and camera provide additional protection against scratches and direct impacts.Functionality:The Commuter Series Case is designed with user convenience in mind. The port covers keep dust and debris out of the charging port and headphone jack, which is a nice touch. The buttons are covered but remain highly responsive, ensuring that there's no compromise on functionality. The case also works seamlessly with wireless chargers, so you don't have to remove it every time you need to charge your phone.Grip and Handling:One of my favorite aspects of this case is the improved grip it provides. The textured sides ensure that the phone doesn't slip out of your hand easily, which is particularly useful if you're always on the go. The slim profile also makes it easy to slide the phone in and out of pockets.Value for Money:While the OtterBox Commuter Series Case is on the pricier side, the level of protection and durability it offers justifies the cost. It‚Äôs a worthwhile investment to safeguard your expensive device from everyday wear and tear.Conclusion:In summary, the OtterBox Commuter Series Case for iPhone 11 in Black is an excellent choice for anyone looking to protect their phone without sacrificing style or functionality. It provides robust protection, enhances grip, and maintains the sleek look of the iPhone 11. I highly recommend this case to anyone in need of reliable and stylish phone protection."

The problem is after quite a few years of use and abuse, my Otter Box case was pretty beaten up and started to come apart. Not being ready to get a new phone just yet, I decided to look for another Otter Box. I found this on Amazon (obviously) at a very reasonable price, and retired my old case. The new case fit well and looks great. It's not quite a sealed up as the old one was. There is no flap over the silencing switch for example, but I don't plan on submerging this phone any time soon. Otherwise the phone seems well protected. I've always liked Otter Boxes, having used their product exclusively since my first iPhone and will continue to do so. It';s a good quality product."

But I had the same model last time, and it lasted for several years. I drop my phone all the time (sadly), and the screen never broke or got scratched. The thing took all kinds of abuse. For years. This time, I went with the blue instead of black because sometimes the black was hard to spot on surfaces. I put a sticker on it, but...meh. This time, I decided on blue. I like the color choices more for the newer models. I was worried this blue was going to look cheap, but it looks good in person. I expect I'll have this until the phone dies."

Got a great deal on a new cellphone plan along with a free Iphone 13.  Being and old guy and not that tech savvy I asked my adult grandkids for a recommendation on a good case for my new iphone.  Based on their recommendation I purchased this Otterbox ""Commuter"" case.  I wanted a case that wasn't too bulky and would work on standard QI wireless chargers.  Here are the positive findings so far:1.  the case fits the Iphone 13 like a glove.  All of the controls work perfectly2.  the Iphone inductively charges  on my Anker wireless charger3.  the case is not bulky but looks to provide adequate drop protection although I am not going to try that4.  the Iphone 13 on its own is extremely slippery and without a case I am sure it will get dropped.  This case has a secure feel5.  the case has a rim that protrudes above the front glass so that the glass won't get scratch from lying it down.I don't have anything negative to add at this point although I can't speak to the cases durability or its drop protection.
