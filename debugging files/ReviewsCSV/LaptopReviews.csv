For the price you're getting a decent processor and a really sleek looking machine. This notebook makes for a good travel computer and the batter lasts a long time. Just remember when you're done setting it up to take it out of S mode or else you wont be able to download any programs. Overall a great bang for you're buck."

It was easy to set up..Great price. I have simple needs being retired.Streaming should be better with the larger screen.. I am looking forward to learning some new skills. It's lighter to carry onto flights too. So far, so good."
"18.5 Inch Laptops Windows","Linda","September 19, 2024",5,"Cheap, but still not worth it","I did not pay a lot for this laptop compared to more popular brands. I can not recommend that anyone buy this model. Some of the functions work fine, but once you plug in a couple of peripherals, it basically goes haywire. If you are using this as a standalone, you might be ok. If you're wanting to plug in an additional display, I would keep shopping."
"18.5 Inch Laptops Windows","Kris Yager","October 6, 2024",5,"Better than my last HP","This is a really nice laptop.  It performs just as well as the name brand laptops,  if not better. I love the large screen.  Screen resolution is excellent and the price can't be beat.  I would definitely order again."

"Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH","","August 10, 2024",4.4,"Everything I was looking for","Pretty good laptop. Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k."
"Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH","Amazon Customer","August 3, 2019",4.2,"This is NOT a Budget Laptop!","This is the best laptop deal you can get, full stop.Touchescreen? Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."
"Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH","thomas","July 30, 2023",4.4,"Basic use, 4 GB ram is not enough, makes a good Linux VPN share laptop.","I bought two of these laptops in the summer of 2020 for $299 and $310. The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed  Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux “bookworm” Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds.  Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds.  The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop.  Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good.  If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery.  These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that. In its stock configuration 4 GB of ram would be a bad day for windows."
"Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH","David Fisher","November 20, 2024",4.5,NA,"This isn't a gaming computer, but if you're just using it to do your taxes or email, reports or word doc's, its a great machine. It has more memory than you will ever use for these purposes. But it is inexpensive and doesn't have the great video and sound cards that you need for gaming. Its a decent personal computer. Would recommend."

Only thing & this is my fault for not doing enough research, it has a 15"" screen which for me is a little small. I would have no problem buying this brand again just I would look for a larger screen. Nice computer!"
"Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH","Wolfgang kron","September 21, 2023",4.5,NA,"Tiene un rendimiento muy muy bueno, no se ha trabado para absolutamente nada, ahora quien se ha quedado lento es mi internet jaja, su calidad en todo sentido es excelente, lo que no me agrada del todo es su cargador, pero, sin duda es lo mejor para el precio, sobretodo aquí en México que para ese precio te ofrecen laptops con calidad horrible, de verdad que la volvería a encargar de nuevo, no se calienta, estéticamente es preciosa, su procesador es de lo mejores, la memoria sí que no es grande pero a la vez siento que está bien para que el procesador pueda rendir de la mejor manera, igual ya existen los discos duros, así que no hay pierde, si quieren algo de excelente calidad, estéticamente precioso y con un precio bajo, es la mejor opción ya que cuenta con prácticamente todo lo necesario casi para hacer cualquier cosa, no tuve tampoco ningún problema con el envío ni nada, la trajeron de Estados Unidos a México y todo muy bien (dato: la cámara también está preciosa cuando hay buena iluminación y el audio es muy bueno, no muy alto pero sí mucho mejor que el de mi laptop pasada sin duda)."

"ASUS 2024 Vivobook Go","","April 29, 2024",4.1,"As a music player, it’s perfect","I used to have E210A when I was in London in 2021. One drawback of that old E210A was that it only had 64GB storage. There was not much space left after Windows upgrades and installations of apps. This 2024 model with a larger storage of 128GB has completely resolved the problem. When I saw it on Amazon, I immediately ordered one without hesitation.Sure it is slow, not a good tool for any complicated work. However, for me it is a perfect music player. It’s very cheap in price, small in size, light in weight, fanless, and with a respectable battery life. I installed a 2TB SSD and put all my music files on it. I then connected it with my Benchmark DAC3 HGC and active speakers. Running foobar2000 I am in the music heaven. I can also use it to listen to internet radios, Spotify, Apple Classical Music, and so on. It’s just BRAVO!And, hey, it still does well on basics like internet browsing and youtube videos. By paying such a small amount of money, I am completely satisfied.PS. For web browsing, use Edge instead of Chrome. Edge is faster and less demanding on ram tha Chrome in this low-end laptop."
"ASUS 2024 Vivobook Go","Amazon Customer","May 17, 2024",4.1,"Not good for games","Excellent device Microsoft 365 and all that took a while to download everything but does what I need we'll now that it's all downloaded external hard drive recommended cause base programs eat the memory quick and at 3 g ram doesn't play games well so xbox app pre install is a bust"
"ASUS 2024 Vivobook Go","CT","August 26, 2024",4.4,"Terrific PC for the money.","Very inexpensive PC but with lots of features and capabilities for the money.  I wanted a compact PC to replace obsolete Surface Pro2, and this fits the bill.  More I/O ports than in product description including audio and HDMI.  Comes with Windows11. One negative is that it comes with Windows S-mode.  This blocks installing apps that Microsoft hasn't ""blessed"", and they push their own apps.  A REAL NUISANCE!  Shutting it off was a bit of a hassle, but figured out how to do it.  Then got computer set-up the way I wanted it.  S-mode is a Microsoft issue, not an ASUS issue, so can't really blame computer for this."
"ASUS 2024 Vivobook Go","B7ack7otus","September 13, 2024",4.7,"Great 11.6"" laptop, Asus quality","First: it doesn't come with the shown SD card reader. Bummer, but it also wasn't in the description so... This is a great little laptop, easy to carry around, easy to use, and quick enough for standard usage. I can understand if it isn't powerful enough for hard gaming, but at it's price, nothing is. I love the portability, the fact it runs Windows 11, comes with 1 year of 365, and 128gb. This Vivobook feels like a larger computer and the keys have a normal travel length (unlike some other small and or cheap ones). Would highly recommend if you need a inexpensive computer that does everything a standard user asks of it. Better than buying a refurbished 8 year old technology one."
"ASUS 2024 Vivobook Go","JDC","May 14, 2024",4.5,"SLOW and S-mode is horrible. 2 day old Computer locks up","The media could not be loaded.
                
            
                
            
            
        
    
    
Update. My 11 year old daughter used it for a couple hours and played Roblox. She said she couldn't hardly play it's so laggy and then went to YouTube on the browser. After 5 minutes the screen message sorry something went wrong popped up and the computer rebooted by itself.Save you precious time and stay away from this one.This one is being returned.I guess if you just wanted to use this to browse the internet using the default browser for Microsoft then you would be okay as a retiree who has extra time on your hands. I spent hours last night setting up parameters with I was expected on buying a new machine but for some reason this Microsoft computer came up with its own generated email which oddly related to the business I work for but had no connections with that email but it processed and was working. One of the first things I try to use the computer for was printing a document and with the Microsoft S Mode it would not allow me to download the driver for my printer. It came up with some purchasing options for drivers that might work so I attempted to turn S Mode off and the computer was freezing up while I was opening the browsers to search how to do this and then when I attempted to turn it off the screen would just flash and the dialog box that supposed to come up and say it's turned off flash on and then turn right off and you couldn't even see what it read. It would not turn the S Mode off so because of all these issues I chose to spend the time and restore the computer back to New and start all over. Doing that brought me back to reinstalling my actual email for Microsoft and was able to bring the computer up the way it should have in the first place but also I was able to manipulate my way into finding where to turn the S Mode off and this time it allowed it to turn off. It notes Once you turn estimate off you can't turn it back on. But I would assume you just restore the computer and that's how you would get it back if you really wanted that horrible program that locked you into only using Microsoft software. I downloaded Chrome and the system wasn't too happy with that at first so I had to close the program and open it back up a couple of times and then it started working fine. As you can see in the video I was attempting to go through already installed applications and you would watch the page be blank and then slowly populate. I downloaded Roblox and that took approximately 7 minutes while the screen stayed frozen and the timer showed it was barely downloading and all of a sudden it popped up saying downloaded and would you like to open the app. Overall I would send this back if I wasn't going to get charged a restocking fee but technically there's nothing wrong with the computer it's just a entry level product that knowing spending under $200 for you might be getting into. I hope this helped out if you're thinking it was going to be a faster more 2024 year-like computer but you'll end up expecting a computer that feels like the old one you got rid of that has a few viruses on it causing it to be laggy."

"ASUS Chromebook CX1 14""","","February 13, 2023",4.1,"BEST Bang for buck for Chromebook","I got the 15 inch, i needed this mostly for a good laptop, long battery life, USB C Charging, and price. I looked at several ""higher"" contenders, but for the 8g RAM, 64gb HD plus SD Card slot, battery life, size, and quality, you're not going to find a better sub- $300 chromebook. All others that compare are closer to $600-1000.Battery life isn't quite 11 hours with the most recent updates, more like 6-8. I use this primarily for online EHR for the facility I work for, and it's great. While some may not like the screen with more advanced (read as >$750 models), it is also a little blah appearing screen BECAUSE of the anti-glare. This means I can chart and do notes outside without sacrificing efficiency. Overall, the only ""missing"" thing is a touch screen. My main laptop is a Surface Pro 7, so I'm not really missing this. This is a fantastic true ""lap"" top.Unlike others, I have used other Chromebooks. This is superior for the PRICE."
"ASUS Chromebook CX1 14""","Amazon Customer","July 24, 2023",4.2,"won't turn on","i bought this in feb. and it stopped working in june. (guarantee  up April ) i get a message to put in a recovery stick. there is no recovery stick with it so you have to make your own. first you need a computer with microsoft on it. if i had that i wouldn't have needed to buy a chromebook. what a waste. it is cheaper to buy a new one than repair at computer store. won't buy asus again though. BTW, i am typing this on my old (very old) acer c720 which works great, just cannot be up graded to work with my bank."
"ASUS Chromebook CX1 14""","D. Blair","August 11, 2022",4.1,"Large display, but Color and Speakers just ok","I love my new laptop, but the colors displayed on screen are just ok...not very vibrant, average for my own use, and can be fixed a bit tilting the screen at a better angle. I was online shopping and some of the clothing looked very light and images were not very saturated...I wouldn't recommend this for anyone using this laptop for design etc. Good for basic home use, work use, student use.  Beautiful background themes to choose from, excellent Google product use, and I easily installed a wireless bluetooth mouse. The screen is nice and large, especially at this price point of around $200. I bought this on Prime Day and I'm happy with my purchase. I can run Google with many tabs open without any problem. I do wish the speakers were a bit better. I listen to music on my phone or Alexa instead because the speakers are small and located in an odd place....right on the front outer rim of the laptop on either side of where it opens. I used it to watch a movie on my bed and had the volume at max and still had a little trouble hearing everything. The bedding also sometimes blocked the speakers because of their location. Basic volume on regular Zoom meetings, YouTube etc. would be fine. I recommend this laptop for normal basic use...it works fast, beautifully designed and has lots of ports which is very convenient. Another thing I wanted to mention is that it wouldn't turn on at first even after charging for hours. I had googled many troubleshooting ideas and nothing seemed to work. Finally after cursing it and almost giving up, it magically made a ""bling"" sound and came on. Make sure to charge it from a wall outlet; not an extension cord or power strip. I think it was still in shipping mode, so I had to google what keys to hold down to make it boot up for the first time. There are just those few things, otherwise I love the laptop for my needs, and would recommend Asus products. Touchpad is very quick and responsive. It is not a touch screen monitor...I'm thinking people are confusing touch screen with touch pad. Keyboard is comfortable and battery has been long-running."

Great for students, and if you want to make some room maybe for a basic game or more RAM just remember they preinstall A LOT of apps.

Great Performance for needs, I love the compact size, durability I mean it is a laptop so a few drops are okay but still be careful. Good comfort level. Fits in my lap easy and light.

"HP Portable Laptop Student","Klab51163","August 6, 2024",4,"HP does not honor warranty","I thought this was just the right PC for us. We don't need much, web browsing, some gaming, some MS Office work. Yesterday I saw that the laptop OS needed update so started it. Noticed it was taking some time so I just let it do its thing all day. Went to turn the laptop back on that evening, and got a flash from the monitor but nothing else. I knew it wasn't a power issue because the separate mouse (not included) was lit, indicating it was connected. Tried everything I could think of then went to HP website. HP tells me there's 15 days left on the warranty (""whew!"") and gave me repair options (phone, chat, local warranty provider [Best Buy]). I chose to go to Best Buy. They worked on the laptop for about 25 minutes, and while I can't tell exactly what was done, I do know it was a series of keystrokes and a flash drive. Geek Squad hands the laptop back to me and tells me it's a hardware issue and not worth the cost of repair. I take the laptop back home and get in a chat with technical support. They have me do what appears to be the same steps Geek Squad did. Then they tell me I need an empty flash drive to reset/reinstall the BIOS. Now I'm not really that tech savvy, but I know enough to tell the technician that all the steps that they have had me do I already had done by Geek Squad, their authorized repair center. Tech tells me that without doing that last step with the empty flash drive they cannot determine that it is truly a hardware issue (really??!) and that they won't be able to give me a repair/replacement if I don't take that last step.Sorry, HP, but you cannot convince me that the cost of a replacement laptop is worth more than the bad taste in my mouth, and my withering review (not only on Amazon, but to anyone who asks) of your inability to honor your very limited warranty. I can't imagine why you wouldn't send a replacement of a low-end laptop just to keep positive goodwill towards your customers. And it's why I strongly suggest anyone reading this review to search for a different unit."

At first, they were ok, but within a couple of weeks they became VERY slow and would crash if you had more than one software application running.  They were basically unusable.  Unfortunately, we had spent a lot of time installing software on them so I really didn't want to return them if I could help it.  I decided to try an upgrade to the memory before I sent them back.  I ordered actual HP branded 32 GB DDR4 So-DIMM memory sticks and sure enough they now are working just fine.  The laptops are ""upgraded"" when you buy them to 16GB using ""ADATA"" branded memory and of course that memory's warranty is void if you remove it.  So I'm out the cost of the new memory but at least I have functional computers.  Also, the HD is only 64 GB and is already full.  If you plan on using this for online only these are probably fine, but if you want to install anything, spend a little more money and get a machine with better memory and a bigger HD.I rated this a 3, the computer is a decent computer, but the upgraded memory for me was a big miss."

I have received two requests from Windows and Asus to advertise to me. I feel like I purchased spyware by accident. I have purchased Windows and Asus products in the past, and they were adequate, but I do not believe I will do so again.You don't get this hassle with Linux or Apple, nor Android (at least when I had one).EDIT: You cannot make a local account with Windows 11 Home S, your quickest bypass will be making a new account using a temporary email address (I like temp-mail.org) so that you can check codes they send you. From there you can use the windows store to find the 'disable s mode' (not called exactly that but literally on the windows store). If you want to go for a Linux OS you'll need a thumb drive to put the new OS on, you'll want to follow a guide but the gist is that you'll boot from the thumb drive and install the OS from there. I went for Linux Mint, I don't think you'd need a lot of technical skill but some comfort with googling will be required as there are some small hitches you can encounter.

"ASUS Vivobook Go 15.6”","Zachary Chandler","November 24, 2024",4.2,"Massive light bleed from screen, even with calibration, SDR, no HDR","I wanted to like this laptop but I'm having so much backlight bleed. The whole screen is a hazy glow and the TN panel amplifies it. I've tried every setting to try to control it, from the Windows display settings, to the Radeon settings, to the calibration, I couldn't get it to show right. I have other monitors to compare it to, so it's even more obvious. It's nearly impossible to get a contrast going. For $199, it's such a great deal. But I have a feeling they gave this Ryzen 3 variant a worse panel. The Ryzen 5 version is nearly $100 more but if you really look at the specs, there's no practical difference other than a very tiny slight clock. I cannot imagine what's going on there. It's so hard to get info if this is a defect on mine, a defective in general, a defect for the Ryzen 3 variants or this is truly what it's supposed to be. ASUS obfuscated model numbers and SKUs. So you will end up on the Ryzen 5 variant. I really wanted to like it because everything else is just fine. I have no complaints about the performance, the quality of the body itself, the keys, etc, especially for the price. I'm not expecting ""quality"" with the panel either. But it's so strange that only one other comment acknowledges the backlight bleed issue.If you try to Google Youtube reviews about it, it seems like foreign reviewers are talking about an almost exact variant but not quite because there's have key backlit and they praise the screen for being good enough.The backlight bleed and hazy glow is enough to give me a headache and just make the whole experience unusable and I say this as someone that is usually not too bothered about ""quality""."

"Acer Aspire Go 15","Amazon Customer","September 14, 2023",4.5,"Fast pc that feels like a Chromebook but with the functionality of Windows 11","I bought this laptop for writing and taking online classes primarily, and it's just perfect.  Keyboard is nice to use.  Screen is bright and crisp.  Laptop is lightweight.This is NOT a laptop for gaming, video editing, demanding graphics work, and you're probably going to get frustrated if you are a busy, multi-tasker with multiple software and dozens of browser tabs open at the same time.That being said, for basic computing needs (word processing, watching Netflix, web browsing, blogging, writing a novel, taking classes, etc...), this laptop is near perfect and budget-friendly.Couple Notes: - The processor is 1.1 ghz, not 2.8 as listed in description, but really, you wouldn't be doing anything on this that should ever require that much processor speed. - Memory is upgradeable, which is nice, but I've found that 4gb is fine for what I'm using it for right now. - Laptop looks stylish, but lacks that ""high-end"" feel - but it's a $200 laptop.  Still, I like it and keyboard feels good for typing at length. - Screen is sharp.  Colors are decent.  Not the best screen out there, of course, but certainly not bad at all.  Not a touch screen...slight bummer but not a big deal to me. - Sound coming from speakers is nice and loud.  No, not premium sound, but sufficient to watch movies/video classes and hear it just fine.  I'm happy with it, but no audiophile.  Use headphones or a Bluetooth speaker if you want better sound. - Performance has been fast and I've been satisfied. - Easy to switch from Windows S to full Windows Home, which is my preference and why I opted for this over a Chromebook. - 81gb of available storage space after OS and apps take up a bit of the 128 gb drive.  To me, that's totally fine since I'm not saving anything on this - it all goes in the cloud. - I don't think the battery will actually last 9 hours with normal settings, but I get a solid 5 or so hours out of it between charges.RE: Slowness/Lagginess:A couple negative reviews mentioned this and when it happened to me, I thought that maybe there WAS something off about this computer.Turns out when I logged into my Microsoft account, it started syncing my existing desktop computer with this laptop, and with only 4gb of memory and slower processor, it just bogged it right down for about 20 minutes or so as it synced apps, desktop icons, etc....  Once everything synced up, it was fine and has been ever since.So if you experience slow, laggy performance when you first get this, and you've logged into your Microsoft account, set it down and let it sync for 20 minutes or so, or better yet, adjust the sync settings to be more selective.All in all, it's a great, inexpensive laptop that is super lightweight, super portable, looks nice, performs great, and is perfect for basic computing, an older child/teen, college courses, etc..."
"Acer Aspire Go 15","Vivian-Tay Pryce","August 10, 2024",4.4,"8.5/10.","UPDATED REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS -the battery life SUCKS. it lasts about 45 mins. i always have to keep the laptop plugged in. the laptop still takes forever to turn on when you hold the power button too. but besides all of that, roblox still runs great. which was my main use for the laptop. so if you want a affordable laptop just to use roblox, i recommend. just keep in mind you’d have to keep the laptop plugged in all the time, which can be annoying.i bought this laptop mainly for browsing, netflix, youtube, and roblox. this laptop runs roblox GREAT. no lag, no freezing, & the app loads up quickly. i’m so happy.— the PROS of this laptop:it works perfectly fine. i bought it used to save some money, and this laptop works like its brand new. the setup process was pretty easy, and its not slow loading up websites n apps. i was afraid that this laptop being in S mode would give me a problem, but i turned it off with a click of one button and that was it. S mode was turned off instantly and now i can download or search whatever website i want.— the CONS of this laptop:the sound quality isn’t the best.. and the screen quality isn’t the best either. is it doable? yes. have i seen better? also yes. also, this laptop takes a while to turn on, i have to hold the power button for 20 secs for it to turn on.-but anyways, i would recommend to anyone looking for a laptop on a budget!how did i turn S mode off? i wanted a new browser to use, so i chose google chrome. i went to download it, and it said something like “google chrome cannot be downloaded because this PC is in S mode” and it literally told me how to turn it off, it took less than 5 secs to turn it off. some other review said that they went through a lot to turn S mode off, so that’s why i was hesitant to buy this laptop, but everything ended up working out perfectly. i’m satisfied with this purchase tbh. i think it’s worth the money 100%."
"Acer Aspire Go 15","Davy","October 11, 2024",4.6,"Excellent deal for the PrimeDay $219 Price","This isn't the best PC laptop in the world, but likely one of the best PC laptops out there in the low $200 range. I ran it through a Passmark CPU benchmark and scored an 11,500 while attached to the charger which is quite impressive for this price range. I ordered this specifically for light duty use, and to replace a 14 year old Core i7 Dell Latitude that I ran HP Tuners software on to tune my hot rod. This Go 15 runs Win 11 Home very well. The first thing I did was take it out of S mode, deleted bloatware and other Microsoft apps that I will never use. After cleaning it up and updating it, I am thoroughly impressed with this PC, and how smoothly it actually runs. Especially since it was under $240 total with tax. The battery life seems great. I am certain it is severely lacking in battery in comparison to higher end laptops, but for what it is, 8hrs is excellent IMO. This is a huge upgrade over my old laptop, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.Don't get me wrong, this is an entry level laptop for sure. If you game or heavily multi-task, get something with a more powerful processor and graphics. If you are a light user and want something that you can take with you, easily browse, easily stream video and hook up to a large TV... This will work well for that for sure."
