"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","Amazon Customer","June 30, 2024",4,"Awesome for the price.","Very impressed for $200.  Looks nice.  It's reasonably light weight.  Not quite used to the shifting yet, but the bike is pretty quick without much effort.  Took 5 minutes to set up with the tools provided.  Though, you're better off using a real screwdriver and wrenches if you have them.The only downside is the seat.  It's rock hard, and without rear shocks, it's pretty uncomfortable."
"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","David Kinney","November 18, 2024",4,"great bike at a decent price","quality bike for the price. it came right away and was very easy to assemble. smooth ride and great looking bike. worth a look and buy"
"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","Rocket robot","December 30, 2023",4,"Not a good purchase","Bought this for my 10 yo for Christmas.  Bike took some time to assemble but came together pretty easily.  Issues:The wheels are not straight and contact the brake pads sporadically while riding, making a scrubbing sound.  I made significant adjustments to the brake pad spacing but could not easily dial it in to the spacing referenced in the manual - needed wider spacing to avoid contacting the tire.The derailleurs were not indexed properly.  I followed the instructions step by step to set the low and high limits, then adjusted the thumbscrews to adjust the indexing.  I spent 4 hours (not exaggerating) adjusting and could not get the shifting to work properly - it skipped gears, and the bike would often shift gears on its own while pedaling.  Front derailleur was trash, could never get it to shift into the smallest gear.  The shifters were “tight” especially for the front gearing, my son couldn’t even shift it to the smallest gear because it was so tight.Ultimately I decided to return it, too much wasted time trying to make it functional.  Don’t waste your time on this bike, it’s trash just like many of the other reviewers said.  I wish I’d listened to them, but I was attracted to the positive reviews and the price seemed reasonable.At the very least, don’t trash the box after buying it, because you can’t return it without the box.  I had to buy a $20 bike box just to return it after trashing the original box (which was damaged on the bottom).  Fortunately Amazon covered the cost of the bike box and made this return process pretty easy."
"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","Sneaky","April 3, 2024",5,"Not bad for the price!","Quick and easy to put together. The only thing is the front wheel came in and the rim is a little bent. Other than that great bike for the price."
"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","Melissa","November 17, 2024",4,"Priced well","Good price, easy to put together, works excellent for a 9 year old that’s almost 5ft."
"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","Tara Duncan","May 11, 2023",5,"Solid Structure, Sleek, Well Built>AFFORDABLE........","WOW, It took me a FULL Week to decide which Huffy sized Bike I would buy. I originally was going to purchase the 20 inch til I saw for a ""girl"" I assumed this meant a child. YES I am short 5 feet. So then I went looking for a 22 inch.I could not find one.Now my 2 brothers growing up had the sting ray cool looking Huffy bikes. So I strictly surfed HUFFY Mountain Bikes still NO 22 inch, what did I know, I have not ridden a bike in 37,38 years, lol, lol. The info on inches and heights was there right in front of me..This AWESOMELY made, relatively easy to put together, took about 1 1/2 hours>PERFECT!. I watched the video which clearly walks you through the entire process. OH My the Crisp Red color,The sleek cool looking awesomely light weight solid structured fit me to the TEEEEE...This Bike is NOW in my TOP 3 items I have ever purchased on Amazon..that I cherish the most..The cost is nothing compared to how I/We/You are going to feel proudly riding on this Bike. I rate this Huffy Mountain 21 Speed, 24 inch Huffy Bike a Perfect ""20""....Now instead of driving to Lake Champlain I will ride there...."
"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","lyd","October 12, 2020",5,"Brakes are too short","EDIT 10/22 The seat broke. It keeps tilting back when I sit on it. I literally cannot tighten the nuts anymore. The seat is going to have to be replaced. Really pisses me off.This is a pretty good bike. I got this bike after spending years riding my mon's old Giant(which costs about $500 in today's money), and while it doesn't quite measure up to that one, it still feels pretty comfortable. It rides smoothly, and the gears are noticeably different from each other. I switch gears a lot when going against the wind or going up or down hill, so it was important the gears worked well.I brought it to a bike shop to put together instead of doing it myself to avoid any problems from poor assembly. Early on I had an issue with the right brake sticking, and I took it to the bike shop that put it together but it unstuck at that point and the bike shop couldn't see any problem. The brake hasn't stuck since, so it could just be that the bike needed breaking in.A bigger issue with the brakes is that they're simply too short. I can't comfortably rest my fingers on them when I'm riding (which you should always do to be safe). I can only really get one finger on them. The brakes are only half the size of the handle, and the inner part of the handle is taken up by the gear mechanism, so I can't put my hands any closer to the brakes without accidently changing the gears. Seeing as this is a women's bike, and women have smaller hands then men, this is strange. It's a minor issue though.Overall I'm really happy with this bike, especially considering I didn't have much of a choice since it seems there's a bike shortage because of the pandemic."
"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","Lynette","February 3, 2024",1,"It is the right bike for the price","Quality is good,  it is for weekend rides,  nothing hardcore, or for competition level..but is a good buy if you know what you needs are."

I have bought it a month ago. And today when I ride on the road, the handle is easily move which makes me fall on the ground. Luckily, I did not in dangerous , just bleeding a bit, but if people ride it in some bad environment or near a car. I can not believe what will happen"
"Huffy Stone Mountain Hardtail","siyao sheng","April 30, 2022",5,NA,"Purchased a new bike for my grandson.  Received April 9th - Assembled (Gift for Easter) Given to him April 17th - Bike is not usable.  When riding over rough ground, seat pops up for no reason-unable to just adjust- has to be removed and corrected with wrench.  Tried 3 chats to have this seat replaced and was offered a $20 discount and I can go out buy a replacement seat.  WOW, where is warranty, where is customer service - asking me to disassemble this bike - rebox it and return it for a refund vs just replacing the defective part.  This is not acceptable when making purchase of a new product."

"HILAND 26 27.5 Inch","Amazon Customer","November 5, 2024",4.6,"Really great mountain bike","This bike arrived well protected and had absolutely no shipping damage, which is impressive. Assembly was pretty straightforward, although the instructions provided no guidance as to how to get the front wheel past the brakes when installing it.  I removed one brake pad and then reinstalled it after passing the wheel through the brakes.  Everything else was a breeze, and everything fit together perfectly, with no missing or broken pieces.This bike is SOLID.  I am very impressed with the quality for this price.  The paint finish looks really nice.  The shifters are smooth and easy to operate.  The brakes do not require a lot of force to bring the bike to a quick stop.  I was not sure what to expect from this brand I had not heard of, but this really is a great bike."
"HILAND 26 27.5 Inch","Customer Review","November 14, 2024",4.5,"Good bike","This is a really good bike. Smooth rolling and brakes good. It may not have top tier parts but it gets me from point A to B without issues. The tires are decent in wet condition with no issues on slipping. The frame is steel and no replaceable derailleur hanger. Overall, the front forks help absorb some bump for a smoother ride and shift gears good."
"HILAND 26 27.5 Inch","Tuam Lis","November 20, 2024",3.2,"Durable Mountain Bike for Adventurous Rides","Exploring trails has become a thrilling adventure with this sturdy mountain bike. The multiple speed options make tackling various terrains smooth and efficient. Its robust steel frame withstands rugged paths while providing a comfortable ride. The brakes respond promptly, enhancing safety during descents. Assembly was straightforward, and it's been a reliable companion on both casual rides and challenging excursions."
"HILAND 26 27.5 Inch","jph55","October 30, 2024",4.1,"Very fast to assemble - fun little bike","The frame is surprisingly light for steel and it looks well constructed. It came more assembled than I excepted, easy to finish the assembly and get the rideable.  It's sort of a mountain bile but really a decent town cruiser.  It has cheap tires and could benefit by nicer tires, they are rated for 198lbs and 40 psi. The brakes work fine and were easy to adjust. I like the feel of it on the road.  I am using it as a fun little shop cruiser to run errands."
"HILAND 26 27.5 Inch","Essential Sailing Industries","November 12, 2024",4.2,"Sturdy and steady ride","The reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because the gear selectors have low quality printing on them. I feel my way through the gears based on the resistance, so this is not a deal breaker, but detracts from the overall quality of the bike.The packaging is excellent, there is no movement of any of the parts, so no scratched paint.  It contains the tools and parts necessary for assembly and the assembly is straight forward.  They have included the nuts on the cross bar to add a water bottle or pump.Overall, it is easy to assemble and rides fairly well, but I believe the price is a bit high for the quality issues mentioned, so look for a good sale."

"Mongoose Flatrock 21-Speed Hardtail","","September 5, 2024",4.1,"Mongoose Bikes At Their Best!!","Legendary reliability and development on full display with this large, capable, and comfortable Mongoose mountain bike!"
"Mongoose Flatrock 21-Speed Hardtail","Amazon Customer","July 27, 2023",4.3,"""You Get What You Pay For"" Should be the Title for Every Bike Purchased in this Price Range","It's a really heavy Mongoose but .. I knew that when I pressed the ""add to cart"" button.  The hardware on the bike is mediocre but .. knew that.  The bike does everything you need it to do .. unless you're a ""bike person"".  If you ride this too hard .. it breaks.  If you use it for transportation, or if you need a good beater for your kid who will be throwing this at the ground repeatedly until they move out of your house chasing some dream job in cosmetology or whatever nightmare they're dreaming of .. this is the bike for you.Assembly was complicated by the fact that it's just an okay bike.  The tools they include are enough to assemble the bike with but, you can cut your assembly time in half if you just have some basic tools lying around the house.The bike rides and feels fine.  With some fine tuning on the brakes and shifter mechanism, the bike would stop and shift fine.Solid ""bang for the buck"" on this but, if you spend another couple hundred bucks, there are better choices that would be worth much more than the extra investment.All in all .. this is okay and it's fine unless you're really trying to do anything outside the realm of ""commuting""."
"Mongoose Flatrock 21-Speed Hardtail","Carlos Ubirlea","October 3, 2024",4.5,"Good so far","Bike seems well built for the price I probably wouldn’t do anything too crazy but I plan on making this a 5000watt e-bike so I’ll definitely be testing it to the max I wish I paid more attention as this one has rim brakes not disc but it stops good enough for now no big deal I’ll update later on how it’s holding up."
"Mongoose Flatrock 21-Speed Hardtail","Sean C.","February 11, 2024",4.3,"The kiddo likes it.","I had a little bit of trouble getting the breaks set correctly but that was definitely my own incompetence. I watched a YouTube video & was eventually able figure it out. Overall it's a great kid's bike and very pretty!"
"Mongoose Flatrock 21-Speed Hardtail","Will","August 2, 2023",4.1,"Not well made, parts already braking, no customer support","My husband and I recently bought the above bike on Amazon for our son for his birthday. We studied reviews and felt good about this being a good bike for a big kid--he's almost 6' and a stout guy. He loved the look of the bike; however, after a couple weeks of use, we've been very disappointed in the quality and functions of the bike.Here are several items of note:1) The handle bar--this bar, although sleek looking, does not offer much room for adjustment and it is very uncomfortable, even painful, to ride for our son, me (5'8"") and my husband (6'1""). We all experienced pinched shoulders and neck even after riding it just around the block. A neighbor helped us put a different handlebar in to raise the grip a bit, and although it helps, it's not quite the right size for the bike, the overall grip is still pretty narrow. Which means we will have to keep shopping around to make adjustments.2) The handle grips and gear shift--these are entirely too small and spaced too close together! My son's hand, if he grips with a standard 4 finger grip, overlaps with the gear shift, so gears are shifting when he's just holding on to the handlebars and not meaning to shift gears.3) The pedal/crank set--there is a decent amount of wiggle room in this. As I understand, this should be a pretty sturdy feel, but it jiggles. It doesn't appear that this is anything we can adjust, it is as it came. We had the bike professionally put together, and the mechanic noted this right away.4) The kickstand--it has already bent and bends forward with the weight of the bike and no longer works.Overall, we are extremely disappointed in this bike. We feel that for the money, we shouldn't be having all these issues right away with it.  We reached out to the manufacturer, and have not heard any response back. I'd shop for a different bike!"
"Mongoose Flatrock 21-Speed Hardtail","Rin B.","October 9, 2024",4.1,"If you don’t have certain tools you will not be able to ride!!","Ugh was excited for this to come in and now I’m debating on returning. I haven’t even been able to assemble it because it didn’t come with tools to assemble it. I have to find someone who will prolly have the tools. For almost four hundred bucks you guys can add the tools with the purchase! Bike is cute but definitely could be 100% better. I’m honestly unsatisfied and probably gonna end up returning it honestly."
"Mongoose Flatrock 21-Speed Hardtail","Joe Wilkins","October 20, 2022",5,"Easy to Assemble and Meets My Needs","I live in a medium-sized neighborhood; I bought this bike to more easily travel within my neighborhood without having to use my car for very short trips. I have never assembled a bike before, but I was able to assemble this one quite easily. The instructions were a bit confusing, because instructions are included for several different versions of the bike, but once I acclimated to which instructions were applicable to me, it wasn't very hard. I did have to purchase a few items for assembly, but they were not very costly, and they will be useful additions to my toolbox. Assembly really only entailed attaching the handlebars, seat and pedals. All of the gear mechanism was already assembled. The bike is easy to ride and operate. So far, I'm completely satisfied with this purchase!"

"Dynacraft Vertical Alpine Eagle","Amazon Customer","November 13, 2024",4.3,"Dynacraft Mountain Bike","Value for the money.  Good quality."
"Dynacraft Vertical Alpine Eagle","Kenneth","October 6, 2024",4.4,"Cool","Nice product. Not too difficult to assemble. I have been riding it for about 3 weeks now and I would say it has been a smooth ride🤭"
"Dynacraft Vertical Alpine Eagle","It’s super nice","November 19, 2020",4.3,"Nice bike for the money but needs proper assembly","After reading mixed reviews about the bike i decided to buy it because it's perfect for my daughter and the price was great. I was a little worried about it getting damaged in shipping as that seems to be a common complaint. The manufacturer must have addressed that issue because it was double boxed and was well secured and protected in the box.  Upon inspection I found that every bearing was over torqued and hard to move. The steering stem nut was too tight and the steering was very notchy. The crank was hard to turn. The brakes were also very poorly adjusted. I decided to disassemble the bike and put it back together properly. Upon disassembly I found that there was very little grease on any of the bearings. Extended usage of the bike in the condition it came would have caused damage to every bearing resulting in costly repairs and an upset child. I grease all of the bearings and properly torqued them. Now everything operates very smoothly and should last quite a while. The brakes requied some adjustment but that was easy and not very concerning. The other complaint i read about was the front wheel being bent right out of the box. Sure enough mine was bent but it was very minor and I was able the get the wheel straight with a plastic dead blow hammer.All in all it's a great bike for the price. The build quality seems very good for the price. Just know that when you assemble it you will have to address a couple of factory assembly issues. This should be done by someone who is mechanically inclined or just pay a bicycle shop to make it right.This is a $160 bike, not a $500 bike so expect what you pay for, but with a little tlc it is a very nice bike for the money"
"Dynacraft Vertical Alpine Eagle","Erik G. Coxe","August 30, 2023",4.3,"Great budget friendly Bike!","Yes, I was hesitant to buy a bike online without seeing it up close. My 10 year old daughter needed to upsize, and after ALOT of research and not wanting to break the bank, I chose this one (I'm not a bike guy BTW). It was hands down the best summer purchase that I've made for my daughter. I read all of the reviews and decided to find out for myself...I assembled it a few months ago, and I misplaced the instructions since, but I don't recall anything difficult about the assembly. It was pretty straight forward. I did need to adjust the brakes. It took about 30 minutes as I recall.We took a family trip to Yosemite National Park this summer, and my daughter put probably over 50 miles on this thing. It held up perfectly both on and off road. We are just recreational riders however, so I'm not suggesting anything about true Mountain Bike capabilities. It is only a $200 bike after all...It has a beautiful finish when assembled, which my daughter loves. I guess that my only complaint would be that it's a bit on the heavy side but that has not presented any problems. She is just fine handling it. I am extremely happy with my purchase, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat."

"Dynacraft Vertical Alpine Eagle","martin ayers","July 20, 2022",5,"Best purchase!","I was a little hesitant to buy a bicycle online but after reading reviews of this gem I decided to take the leap on Amazon prime day and boy am I glad I did!  I’m very small only 5 feet and I have been bicycling my whole life but for the past past five years got away from it and wanted to get back into it.  First I have to say the bike is very easy to assemble as long as you take the time to read through the instructions first and just take your time and you will be fine.  Not only is it a great looking bike but it is so comfortable and can handle all different terrain which is what I was looking for because I bicycle all over New England and the roads aren’t so good and I also mountain bike so this is a nice hybrid to be able to do both.  The quality is solid the gears are Shimano in our quality and smooth product.  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this bike it definitely was a solid purchase!"
"Dynacraft Vertical Alpine Eagle","Jo C","November 1, 2024",5,"nope","Unless you work in a bike shop don’t bother, absolute nightmare, save your money. Brakes are a nightmare to adjust, need all kinds of tools to assemble and lithium grease, have to read 50 page manual.  Front wheel was warped, threads to screw pedals were striped and couldn’t be screwed on. 7 pounds of box to get rid of, go to Facebook marketplace and buy a used bike next time, live and learn. Not even gonna bother to return."
"Dynacraft Vertical Alpine Eagle","Alexander Supertramp","January 5, 2024",5,"Get What Pay For","I’m not sold on this bike and may still return it. I was looking for a budget friendly bike and came across this one. Reviews were mixed, but it seemed to be mostly with shipping issues (which sounds across the board with Amazon bikes.) The Box did arrive damaged. I would have thought with all the issues with shipping, they would take notice.The bike itself isn’t in too bad of shape. The wheels do have truing issues and dealing with getting the front wheel on with the front break was a two person job for me. For the price, it is what you pay for...But for me, it is quite heavy. I’m still having issues with adjusting the brakes and shifting to 5 doesn’t work. I can go 6 or 4, but not 5. Not crazy about the shifting or brake mechanisms either. And had to buy a cushier seat cover. The seat is too uncomfortable for me. Some of these issues could probably be fixed at a bike shop, but I’m not looking to dump money into it. Biggest drawback though is how heavy it is.For reference, I used to mostly roadbike recreationally when I lived somewhere that was more accommodating for bikes. Not an expert by any means and just wanted something affordable and easy to ride on dirt roads and easy trails once and a while."

"Hiland Full Suspension Mens","","October 1, 2024",4.2,"Affordable, inexpensive, loaded with extras and beautiful.","Bike is really beautiful and rides smoothly. Medium grade difficulty to assemble, seat is very small but I solved it with a gel cover, had an issue with the thread of the left pedal but it was fixed (retreaded) for $8. Minor issues that were solved with $20 total. Everytime I ride it I get compliments of how nice looking it is. Really love it, thank you Hiland. Keep it up.👍 Really affordable and functional"
"Hiland Full Suspension Mens","Amazon Customer","March 8, 2021",4.2,"Highly recommend 100%","I bought this bike because I wanted a mountain bike and could not get one from Liv the brand that I always buy .. I did not have any expectations on it but when I saw the bike I felt in love . I had previously bikes but I don’t do maintenance by myself so I took it the the shop and they did the job for me... also y asked them to advice me if the bike has cheap parts to replace for a good ones and they just said the bike is perfect and excellent quality. I already tan the bike and feel good. The only thing I did was get new grips and pedals because I run  fast on my bike . You could see them at the pictures . Btw when I bought it I did see zero reviews so I took the risk not regrets at all ."
"Hiland Full Suspension Mens","Frank M.","August 21, 2024",4.2,"Uncomfortable seat, but solid frame","As was mentioned on some other reviews, the supplied seat was very narrow and hard, making a quick 15 minute ride somewhat painful. After installing an after market seat with added cushion and width, the ride is much smoother. Otherwise the setup was pretty easy. The gears/derailleurs are a little off, but nothing that a bit of tinkering won't fix. It is also much heavier than i realized. 55lbs i believe."
"Hiland Full Suspension Mens","juliana nino","August 4, 2024",5,"Recommendation is to take it to a bike shop.","This bike is awesome once you take it to a bike shop and get it fixed for the gears, get them set properly.

Bike feels sturdy. Assembly was easy. Rear brake rotor was bent, so a rubbing sound is heard. I am going to try and tweak it back to flat. Amazon only offered a return of the bike, and it isn’t worth that hassle. Tires are disappointing. Not very good tread for true off road mountain biking, but again, good quality for the money. An upgraded softer seat is pretty much a must. Shocks seem nice. Quick release front tire is nice. Overall I’m satisfied based on the price."

"Dynacraft Magna Echo Ridge","Amazon Customer","July 17, 2024",4,"Great bike for the money","This was my birthday present - a bike decked out with a speedomter/light, mirror, chime, alarm, etc. All the accessories also ordered through Amazon (see below).  The bike came perfectly packed and while the assembly also went perfectly, if you've never put together a bike before then you should probably consult with someone who has. The brakes required adjustment but the derailleur was perfect and required no adjustments. Totally satisfied. Well done.The ROCKBROS Bike Bell Classic Bicycle Bell is not the traditional circular bell and matches the motif perfectly. The MEACHOW New Scratch Resistant Glass Lens, Handlebar Bike Mirror also accents well and is probably one of the better mirrors. The VLOXO Bike Speedometer with Bike Light Set also perfect for this bike. That with a cross body sling backpack and I just had a great birthday."

"Dynacraft Magna Echo Ridge","T. Whiddon","June 6, 2022",4,"Not a bad beginner bike, but take care assembling it","The bike is fairly nice for the price.  I haven't ridden a bike in a long time, so I'm not used to it.  The seat is not comfortable, but I was told my behind will get used to it after a while.  The assembly wasn't bad, but be careful of the front break assembly.  Have to loosen it to get the front wheel on.  I loosened it too much and it kind of fell apart and was a pain to get back together properly.  I noticed this problem in a couple of reviews, after I assembled it."
"Dynacraft Magna Echo Ridge","Mena","November 25, 2024",4,"Get what you pay for","The brakes are garbage right off the start. I’ve bought two of these bikes due to them being cheap. And regretted it each time. First one, the brakes squealed constantly. Non stop. And on the handlebars, the handbrake levers are straight down, rather than angled more straight ahead. Meaning it’s very awkward to brake. But it’s so tightened, you can’t loosen it to adjust the angle.After moving and having to get rid of the bike due to no space to take it with me, I replaced it after a while with the same bike. This time, I got one with both brakes WAY too tightened. To a point you couldn’t ride without resistance. And the handlebars have the same issue with the handbrake angle and being too tight to adjust. Annoyed, and not having the tools on hand to adjust the brakes, I went to a local shop to just have it done there.They told me they’d never had as many issues as they do with people who buy this brand when it comes to brakes. They see them constantly. I bought this bike twice because it was cheap. Hoped the first go around was just luck of the draw. But no. It’s just general bad quality. And because it’s a BIKE, it’s not exactly as easy to return. Especially after you took it out of the box and assembled it. Because then you have to take it apart again, get the box in your car, and drag it into a mailing center.Save your money for a good bike."

"AVASTA Earth 26 27.5","Amazon Customer","October 11, 2024",4.7,"Very nice bike","Very nice looking bikeEasy to put together took me less than 30min"
"AVASTA Earth 26 27.5","Nick","September 14, 2024",4.4,"Premium features with mid-grade feel.  Mechanical skills a plus","Some assembly is definitely required, as you would have a ready-to-ride experience if you were to buy a similar bike at a bike shop.  The bike comes well packaged, but that packaging means you'll have to take a chunk of your afternoon clearing a space to assembly and torque down all the critical parts on this otherwise respectable quality bike; probably among the better bikes you'd find at a generic sporting goods store or wholesale.  The instructions, while not perfect, do give you most of the information you need to get the bicycle assembled safely so you can go for a ride the same day, bike repair shop be damned.  If you're mountain biking, you need to learn how to fix your bike on the trail anyway, so it's all in the spirit of it.Once you're assembled and taking it for a spin, you'll inevitably find that a few components need to be adjusted, but the stem being off a bit was slightly annoying.  I would understand if you took a downhill header into a rocky ridge and threw the alignment off, but I would expect that to be straight, true, and torqued to spec from the factory.  Imagine if you bought a car and needed to bring it in for alignment within the first 100 miles.These criticisms aside, there is a lot to like about this bike. Dual disc brakes are vastly superior to traditional caliper setups.  Adjustable front suspension used to be luxury bike territory.  Shimano suspension and braking components keep the experience crispy and responsive. Thoughtful cable runs through the frame tubing keep things neat, but good luck with mud and hosing down your bike after a hard, muddy ride.Overall, the bike is a solid contender for an budget, upmarket mountain bike.  The assembly and materials of some of the systems are a bit lacking and would beg the question of whether this bike will be replaced within the next 5 years.  For my riding and experience, I would think yes, but I feel that it's value-conscious pricing forgives all the clipped corners on this great trail riding vehicle.POST-RIDE EDIT: After going on a bit of trail riding, I'm happy to report the bike has proven itself fairly competent.  The front suspension bottoms out, but I believe that will go away with a bit of adjustment.  The Shimano transmission has crisp shifting up and down the hills and the tires grip well down hills and around berms.  Brakes needed some initial adjustment and are responsive and confident when you need them.  As far as balance, the frame's geometry is not perfect, nor would I expect anything like that at this price; keep your hands on the handlebars.  The seat is also soft and forgiving, which I appreciate as the years roll on.  I reiterate that is a terrific entry-level bike that will get you out and in the trails with more than a few dollars to spare on snacks and accessories."

The disc brakes are a great feature that I have never had on previous bikes. Has Shimano components. The tires are good for pavement or the campground trails that I ride. The suspension can be adjusted to fit your riding style. I ordered the red/black color pattern and love the look."

"Schwinn Traxion Mountain Bike","","February 26, 2019",4.3,"MARCH 30, 2021 UPDATE, 2ND PURCHASE!","The order stated 3 day shipping and it took 6 days, but more importantly FedEx delivered the box all tore up with bottom flaps wide open and the box of pedals lying on the ground outside of the main carton. The bike suffered several deep scratches that really bummed me out! I decided to live with it as I hate to send things back unless I have to. Other than that the bike is very nice at this price point and would have received 5 stars from me if it wasn't damaged, despite the slow arrival.It went together very easily, but did need rerouting of the cables which could not be completely untangled as well as some minor tuning. I also replaced the skinny rock hard seat with a super comfortable TONBUX seat that almost matches the color perfectly (best $20 I ever spent!).  It rides like a dream on the rough dirt and rocky mountain roads near my house, the full suspension and big 29"" tires really soak in the bumps, very smooth.  I am very pleased with the overall performance of the bike so far, it shifts very quickly up and down and the disk brakes are strong. I am 5'9"" tall / 185 lbs. and the bike has plenty of seat adjustment left, I would say it will handle up to a 6'2"" rider, but not much shorter than 5'8"" comfortably. I would highly recommend this bike to anyone that is NOT interested in hard core wide open down hill mountain trail riding. I am sure the bike can handle any trail at controlled speeds, but sustained high speed down hill mountain trail riding needs more bike than this, i.e. hydraulic brakes & better suspension, or in other words spending at least double or triple what this bike cost. At under $400 dollars it is a great bike.UPDATE: After several long rides on very rocky mountain roads and trails I just had to change my rating from 4 to 5 stars. This bike is that nice, and it didn't seem fair to down grade the rating due to slow poor FedEx service.18 MONTH FOLLOW-UP:Loving this well made Schwinn! Have many miles of very hard riding on it now and it is holding up well. Zero issues and still functioning perfectly. There is a slight amount of seepage at the front forks but that is normal. I have just about worn out the tires but that is after a lot of miles, most of which were ridden on rough rocky roads with zero flats. Overall this bike is a winner. Well worth the current price.MARCH 30, 2021 UPDATE:Just purchased a 2nd Traxion for my wife; after she borrowed mine she had to have one. This one arrived in perfect condition via UPS. Had to fine tune the brakes and shifters but that is easy. The people here having pedal/crank problems are causing the problem themselves by installing them dry and severly over tightening them. Put a little grease on the threads and take them down to just beyond finger tight. They are threaded opposite of the crank rotation and will not back out, and if you ever need to replace them they'll come out easily without seizing or galling. Great bike for the money!"
"Schwinn Traxion Mountain Bike","Amazon Customer","May 21, 2020",4.3,"Assembly Info","Assembly:Removal of the bike from the box and removal of all the packaging/protection takes about 15 minutes. It was packed very well and the box was in excellent condition.Bike assembly took about 45 minutes including some minor adjustments. The instructions are okay, they are for several different bikes though. Some of the tools required are not even used, and the size indicated to use is different on some items. It is mostly pre-assembled with only the front wheel, seat, and pedals to install. The handlebar stem comes backwards due to packaging, so you will need to loosen the top bolt under the rubber cap and spin it 180 degrees. Make sure that when you mount the handlebar to the stem, that the cables are not twisted. they should be on each side as they come up the frame. Of course you will need to center the handlebar stem to the front wheel. The only adjustments I had to make after a ride around the yard, was to the front and rear brakes. They needed to be tightened up a little so that the handles were catching the brakes at approx. a 1/3 pull. The manual explains how to adjust.Overall I am happy with it. Looks great! No marks from shipping and all of the stickers are applied correctly. I will add to this review after I put some miles on it!"
"Schwinn Traxion Mountain Bike","Kindle Customer","April 25, 2019",4.3,"At a first glance, super impressed!","When I picked up the package, I was impressed at the condition of the box. There were no smashed corners or gashes. Upon opening the box, I was happy to see such efficient packing, padding and securing of items so nothing rubbed together. The bike arrived with no scratch whatsoever on it!I started to remove the bike and it came out easily. I began removing the padding and cutting zip ties. Everything looked great although I was a bit concerned as there were no instructions included. Upon further unpacking, I could easily see there were minor steps to assembly which became self explanatory. I screwed in the right peddle and a small bearing fell into my hand. I called the number on the bike and explained the situation. In under 10 mins, a new peddle was on its way free of charge. I completed the assembly and took it for a test drive.  The bike felt solid and drove like a champ! This is going to be a fun bike to use on the trails!!"
"Schwinn Traxion Mountain Bike","Eric M.","August 7, 2022",5,"Wasn’t bad at all. Few thing I had to do","Update still going. Got close to 100miles on it.Not bad at all. A few things I had to do.  Adjust the back derailed. And had adjust the front brake.  The seat I’m not sugar coat it. Is rough on the bottom.  And any down hill coasting be careful. I way about 220lbs and was a inch from maxing front forks.  Other then that did well after a total of 10miles of a trail and climbing 900ft up in evaluation and back down. With some hills pretty steep.  Still not a bad but for what u get. Did a 2nd ride on another mountain trail. Climbing 400ft. And doing over 9miles. Still holding up well.  Had zip tie the brake cables etc as the plastic c clips stretch.  So I’m was hearing something rubbing my rear tire.  Then found out what it was and took care of that. I expect few more things as I keep riding. But still not disappointed with my buy.  Will keep editing and updating for more ppl know this product. As they did have some crappy reviews for a while."

"HH HILAND 24 26","Amazon Customer","January 20, 2022",4,"More for your money than big box store brands.","My bike was delivered undamaged by FedEx. The bike looks awesome, and easy to assemble. The factory assembly and tuning seems to be top notch. No additional tuning was necessary out of the box and all gears shift flawlessly. The Hiland Slycan was my choice, after several weeks of shopping around locally and online, and learning what components are included, and researching who made them. Negative reviews were mostly from bad luck in shipping or user error. The bike feels lightweight and agile on my favorite rocky wooded trail here in Texas. The 27.5 large frame is perfect for me at 6-1, and is more agile than my bumbling 29er. I kept in mind when shopping for a mtb which I would rather upgrade at some point, and the Slycan is already fully loaded, unlike many stripped down, over priced store brands. They say the best mountain bike is the one you can afford, and if that's true, this bike is a quality buy. I plan to upgrade to a more comfortable seat, and maybe some funky new peddles, but the bike is just fine as it comes. I found the positive reviews more helpful, and someone made the remark about how this bike impressed other bikers after seeing how it compared to their bikes. I was sold on that note, and I haven't been disappointed."

"HH HILAND 24 26","María Fernanda Delgado","November 9, 2024",5,"Decent, but front brakes suck","I do not know how I feel about having so assemble some parts and if the bike’s performance is anything go by this is a really bad bike.I’ve had to remove the front breaks just to comfortably ride this as not only did they just rub against the front tire but they do not even work as proper brakes."
"HH HILAND 24 26","Felicio ","July 7, 2024",5,NA,"We knew there would be some issues with this bike given the price being below average. Assembly was fine but the main issue is that the handlebars don’t line up properly with the front wheel and will frequently loosen. My daughter has to take the Allen key everywhere and tighten them every 20 minutes which is a bit annoying and would have been dangerous if we hadn’t figured out the issue quickly. Definitely not a mountain bike but is suitable for short rides around the neighbourhood on paved areas."
"HH HILAND 24 26","Emily","July 27, 2022",4,NA,"This is almost the perfect bicycle for general use.Pros:- Nice looking frame and color scheme- Frame has mount points for disc brakes if you wanted to upgrade later- Threadless handlebar mount- Sturdy rims- 3x7 transmission with MicroShift thumb shifters- Allow v-band brake calipersCons:- The v-band calipers use a plastic pushing that bends when braking causing that classic ""cheap stamped steel caliper"" brake howl.- The bars are a bit low.  It comes with the spacers below the bar (max height), but really could use another 1-2"" depending on the riderAll in all, still very pleased.  Ended up buying a 45 degree bar mount to raise the bars off Amazon ($20) and a new set of alloy calipers off Amazon ($30) to make it 5/5."
"HH HILAND 24 26","Guy from Up North","June 28, 2022",4,NA,"This bike delivers a lot for its price. Hydraulic brakes effortlessly bring it to a quick stop with very little pressure applied. The 29"" double wall wheels roll easily making long rides easy with low rolling resistance, one can coast a long ways on this bike. The frame is lite and very solid, no creaks present. My only issue with this bike is the rear derailleur and chain which is literally this bikes only weak link, otherwise it is an excellently executed value of a bike. My chain snapped within the first 300 km, the derailleur has held so far but it reflects its low budget design when shifting.  But I expected to upgrade these parts before purchase. The forks are a heavy but provide a comfortable controlled ride, also the bike saddle as been a pleasent surprise, it is very comfortable.  This cross country bike has been a pleasurable experience to ride, I enjoy it. It really is an excellent value that can be easily improved with a few affordable upgrades if one desires to go that route."

"HH HILAND 24 26","Wilfredo ","May 3, 2022",5,NA,"After being in the bike market for a few days looking at all my options I went with this bike. It's not the best bike but for the price good value. The assembly was not to difficult if you have some basic tool and knowledge to set it up.When I received the bike everything was in good shape but the front tire had a slight bend in it. I contacted there customer service team and they  had me get it repaired locally. They refunded the repair cost and I now have a great entry level bike."
